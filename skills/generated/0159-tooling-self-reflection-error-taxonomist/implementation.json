  "domain": "Tool Reliability and Execution Quality",

  "reason": "We need this skill because automation collapses when tools are flaky and failure modes are opaque. This specific skill classifies recurrent reasoning failures for targeted fixes.",

    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Tooling Self-Reflection Error Taxonomist`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to silent failures and cascading retries.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for tool runs, error signatures, and retry outcomes, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using failure-type clustering, and produce error taxonomies with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover silent failures and cascading retries, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
