# Inclusion Confidence Calibration Engine

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because systems must be operable and understandable for diverse users. This specific skill aligns reported confidence with actual uncertainty.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Inclusion Confidence Calibration Engine" outcomes in the Accessibility and Inclusion domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Inclusion Confidence Calibration Engine`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to barriers for disabled and underserved groups.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for accessibility audits, accommodations, and usability feedback, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using calibration curves and error bins, and produce calibrated confidence scores with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover barriers for disabled and underserved groups, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Runtime profile: optimization-engine using calibration curves and error bins to produce calibrated confidence scores.
- Orchestration integration: accessibility-and-inclusion:optimization-engine routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit, integration, simulation, regression-baseline suites and rollout telemetry.

## Operational Runbook
### Preflight
- Confirm the Inclusion Confidence Calibration Engine request scope, source evidence, and measurable success criteria before execution.
- Verify feature flag skill_0805_inclusion-confidence-calibration, approval gates, and rollback owner before autonomous use.

### Execution
- Execute calibration curves and error bins with deterministic scoring and reproducible trace capture.
- Produce calibrated confidence scores plus scorecard, assumptions, and unresolved-risk notes.

### Recovery
- Fail closed when required signals, evidence, or approval gates are missing.
- Rollback to the last stable baseline when posture is critical or validation fails.

### Handoff
- Publish calibrated confidence scores, validation evidence, and telemetry links to downstream owners.
- Queue follow-up tasks for unresolved risks, threshold tuning, or approval review.

## Guardrails
- [quality] Require deterministic scoring and validation evidence before promotion.
- [reliability] Preserve retries, rollback controls, and failure-mode evidence for every run.
- [safety] Route critical posture or missing approval gates to human review before autonomous action.
