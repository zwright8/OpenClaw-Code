  "domain": "Resource Allocation and Logistics",

  "reason": "We need this skill because impact work fails when scarce resources are not routed intelligently. This specific skill resolves resource and strategy conflicts with explicit tradeoffs.",

    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Logistics Multi-Agent Negotiation Mediator`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to supply shortfalls and fairness gaps.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for capacity, bottlenecks, and distribution plans, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using structured bargaining protocols, and produce negotiated agreement sets with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover supply shortfalls and fairness gaps, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
