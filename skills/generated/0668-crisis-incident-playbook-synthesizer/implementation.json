  "domain": "Crisis and Incident Response",

  "reason": "We need this skill because response quality determines whether incidents are contained or amplified. This specific skill creates repeatable response procedures from incident history.",
  "implementationGuide": [
    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Crisis Incident Playbook Synthesizer`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to slow containment and repeated outages.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for incident timelines, response roles, and recovery artifacts, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using pattern-to-playbook synthesis, and produce incident playbooks with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover slow containment and repeated outages, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
