# Incident Playbook Synthesis for community mediation programs

## Why This Skill Exists
Use incident playbook synthesis in community mediation programs with emphasis on safety, dignity, equity, and long-term societal benefit.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define measurable outcomes for Incident Playbook Synthesis for community mediation programs, including baseline and target metrics for community mediation programs.
2. Specify structured inputs/outputs for incident playbook synthesis and validate schema contract edge cases.
3. Implement the core incident playbook synthesis logic with deterministic scoring and reproducible execution traces.
4. Integrate orchestration policy, routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback for autonomous execution.
5. Run unit, integration, simulation, and regression suites for Incident Playbook Synthesis for community mediation programs under pro-humanity impact conditions.
6. Roll out behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry, and refine thresholds using observed operational outcomes.

## Operational Runbook
Preflight:
- Validate mission scope, contracts, and required inputs.
- Verify feature flag posture, dependencies, and approval prerequisites.

Execution:
- Execute incident playbook synthesis workflow with deterministic scoring and trace capture.
- Track posture transitions and preserve reproducible evidence artifacts.

Recovery:
- Apply rollback strategy if posture is critical or guardrails fail.
- Escalate blocked execution to oversight with incident packet and trace references.

Handoff:
- Publish outcome report, scorecard, and telemetry links.
- Queue follow-up tasks for unresolved risks, approvals, or optimization work.

## Guardrails
- [quality] Require unit and integration validations before promoting Incident Playbook Synthesis for community mediation programs. -> `run-validation:unit+integration+simulation+regression-baseline`
- [reliability] Trigger rollback on critical posture or repeated failures. -> `rollback:rollback-to-last-stable-baseline`
- [compliance] Require policy and approval gates prior to autonomous deployment. -> `approval-gates:policy-constraint-check+human-impact-review`
- [safety] Block production action when risk posture is critical until human oversight review. -> `open-incident:human-oversight`
