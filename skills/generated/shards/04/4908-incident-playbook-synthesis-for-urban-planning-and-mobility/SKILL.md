- Use Incident Playbook Synthesis for urban planning and mobility to accelerate decisions while preserving safety, quality, and auditability.

## Guardrail Policy Matrix
| Guardrail Type | Policy Rule | Automation Hook |
|---|---|---|
| quality | Require unit and integration validations before promoting Incident Playbook Synthesis for urban planning and mobility. | run-validation:unit+integration+simulation+regression-baseline |
| reliability | Trigger rollback on critical posture or repeated failures. | rollback:rollback-to-last-stable-baseline |
| compliance | Require policy and approval gates prior to autonomous deployment. | approval-gates:policy-constraint-check+quality-review |
| safety | Block production action when risk posture is critical until human oversight review. | open-incident:human-oversight |

## Posture Playbook
- **Ready posture (score >= 74):** release artifacts after validation pass and route to `urban-planning-and-mobility:incident-response-engine`.
- **Review posture (score >= 54 or risk >= 62):** require human review before publish, with explicit remediation notes.
- **Critical posture (risk >= 81):** fail closed, execute `rollback-to-last-stable-baseline`, and escalate with incident packet.

## Traceability Map
- **Scope:** Define measurable outcomes for Incident Playbook Synthesis for urban planning and mobility, including baseline and target metrics for urban planning and mobility.
- **Contract:** Specify structured inputs/outputs for incident playbook synthesis and validate schema contract edge cases.
- **Core:** Implement the core incident playbook synthesis logic with deterministic scoring and reproducible execution traces.
- **Orchestration:** Integrate orchestration policy, routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback for autonomous execution.
- **Validation:** Run unit, integration, simulation, and regression suites for Incident Playbook Synthesis for urban planning and mobility under beauty and aesthetic appreciation conditions.
- **Rollout:** Roll out behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry, and refine thresholds using observed operational outcomes.

## Decision & Scoring Policy
- Scoring weights: `truth=0.20, execution=0.20, safety=0.20, impact=0.40`
- Posture thresholds:
  - `ready`: score >= 74
  - `review`: score >= 54
  - `review_risk`: risk >= 62
  - `critical_risk`: risk >= 81
- Retry policy: max attempts `4`, base delay `750ms`, backoff `exponential`.
- Approval gates: `policy-constraint-check`, `quality-review`.

## Validation Gates & Test Matrix
| Gate | Purpose | On Fail |
|---|---|---|
| schema-contract-check | Ensure required inputs and contract shape are valid. | block release |
| determinism-check | Replay identical input and compare output hash/score delta. | escalate + quarantine |
| policy-approval-check | Verify policy constraints and approval tokens. | block publish |
| reliability-check | Validate retry budget and rollback readiness. | rollback to stable baseline |

- Required validation suites: unit, integration, simulation, regression-baseline

## Failure Modes & Recovery Playbook
- `E_INPUT_SCHEMA`: required signal missing or malformed -> reject payload and request corrected input.
- `E_NON_DETERMINISM`: replay mismatch or unstable score delta -> quarantine output and escalate for human review.
- `E_POLICY_BLOCK`: approval/policy gate unsatisfied -> keep publish blocked until explicit approval is attached.
- `E_DEPENDENCY_TIMEOUT`: transient timeout -> apply retry budget; if unresolved, execute `rollback-to-last-stable-baseline` and issue incident packet.

## Human Approval & Escalation
- High-risk or policy-sensitive runs require an explicit approval token before release.
- Escalate to human reviewer when any gate fails twice or critical risk posture is reached.
- Escalation packet must include: scope, failed gate, evidence links, retry history, and recommended decision.

## Automation Envelope
| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Maturity tier | `mission_critical` |
| Autopilot ready | `yes` |
| Parallelism | `2` |
| Max cycle minutes | `15` |
| Required approvals | `policy-constraint-check`, `quality-review` |

## Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] Schema, determinism, policy, and reliability gates all pass.
- [ ] Output artifact bundle includes scorecard, risks, and next actions.
- [ ] Handoff owner confirms artifact usability without additional clarification.
- [ ] Telemetry and trace references are attached for auditability.

## External Tool Stack Recommendation
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Recommendation class | `tool-primary` |
| Migration priority | `P0` |
| External auth required | `yes` |
| API key likely required | `no` |
| Rationale | Deterministic infrastructure and system primitives outperform model-only execution for reliability and auditability. |

| Service | Why in stack | Auth mode | Auth required | API key likely |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Temporal/Prefect/Airflow | workflow state + retries + durable scheduling | account/session credentials | yes | no |
| Argo Workflows/Kubernetes Jobs | execution coordination and rollbacks | account/session credentials | yes | no |
| Redis/Kafka queue | decoupled task transport and backpressure | account/session credentials | yes | no |

## External Integration Migration Checklist
- Provision service credentials and validate non-expired auth before first run.
- Wire service outputs into validation/handoff artifacts.
- Enable credential reuse; prompt user only on missing/invalid/expired credentials.

## Credential Reuse Policy
- Reuse previously provided credentials by default; do not ask for new credentials when a valid credential/session already exists.
- Before prompting, check environment/session secret stores and run lightweight auth validation.
- Ask the user for credentials only if they are missing, invalid, expired, or explicitly revoked/rotated.

## Practical Usage Examples
1. Incident recovery in urban planning and mobility: ingest noisy signals, execute incident playbook synthesis, produce an operator-ready scorecard and remediation queue.
2. Scheduled quality pass: run Incident Playbook Synthesis for urban planning and mobility against baseline data, compare drift, and publish release/no-release recommendation with evidence links.
3. Pre-deployment gate: validate artifacts for urban-planning-and-mobility:incident-response-engine, enforce approvals, then handoff to downstream orchestrator with next actions.

## Anti-Patterns
- Do not publish artifacts when any validation gate fails.
- Do not bypass approval gates for high-risk runs.
- Do not run with missing provenance, schema, or success criteria.
- Do not treat partial/non-deterministic outputs as production-ready.

## Handoff Contract
- **Produces:** `incident-playbook-synthesis-artifact-urban-planning-and-mobility`, scorecard, risk/confidence metadata, remediation backlog.
- **Consumes:** `aesthetic constraints`, `craft references`, `experience traces`.
- **Readiness rule:** release only when schema, determinism, policy, and reliability gates all pass.
- **Downstream hint:** route only to `urban-planning-and-mobility:incident-response-engine` consumers with approval context attached.

## Observability & Continuous Improvement
- SLO: >=99.9% successful runs per 7-day window
- Error budget: <=0.1% critical failures per 7-day window
- Alert triggers:
- critical posture exceeds baseline trend
- validation regression crosses threshold
- hardening or approval bottlenecks persist
- KPI focus: `aesthetic coherence`, `craft quality`, `delight in urban planning and mobility`
- Primary outcome metric: `aesthetic coherence`
- Secondary metrics: `craft quality`, `delight in urban planning and mobility`
- Review cadence: `daily`
- Weekly review: tune thresholds, retries, and approval friction based on telemetry and incident learnings.
