# Curiosity Agenda Generation for healthcare operations

## Why This Skill Exists
Use curiosity agenda generation in healthcare operations with emphasis on best-in-class standards, precision, and repeatable excellence.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define measurable outcomes for Curiosity Agenda Generation for healthcare operations, including baseline and target metrics for healthcare operations.
2. Specify structured inputs/outputs for curiosity agenda generation and validate schema contract edge cases.
3. Implement the core curiosity agenda generation logic with deterministic scoring and reproducible execution traces.
4. Integrate orchestration policy, routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback for autonomous execution.
5. Run unit, integration, simulation, and regression suites for Curiosity Agenda Generation for healthcare operations under professional mastery conditions.
6. Roll out behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry, and refine thresholds using observed operational outcomes.

## Operational Runbook
Preflight:
- Validate mission scope, contracts, and required inputs.
- Verify feature flag posture, dependencies, and approval prerequisites.

Execution:
- Execute curiosity agenda generation workflow with deterministic scoring and trace capture.
- Track posture transitions and preserve reproducible evidence artifacts.

Recovery:
- Apply rollback strategy if posture is critical or guardrails fail.
- Escalate blocked execution to oversight with incident packet and trace references.

Handoff:
- Publish outcome report, scorecard, and telemetry links.
- Queue follow-up tasks for unresolved risks, approvals, or optimization work.

## Guardrails
- [quality] Require unit and integration validations before promoting Curiosity Agenda Generation for healthcare operations. -> `run-validation:unit+integration+simulation+regression-baseline`
- [reliability] Trigger rollback on critical posture or repeated failures. -> `rollback:rollback-to-last-stable-baseline`
- [compliance] Require policy and approval gates prior to autonomous deployment. -> `approval-gates:policy-constraint-check+human-approval-router`
- [safety] Block production action when risk posture is critical until human oversight review. -> `open-incident:human-oversight`
