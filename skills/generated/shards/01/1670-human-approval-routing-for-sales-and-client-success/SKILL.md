description: Operate the "Human Approval Routing for sales and client success" capability in production for sales and client success workflows. Use when mission execution explicitly requires this capability and outcomes must be reproducible, policy-gated, and handoff-ready.

# Human Approval Routing for sales and client success

## Why This Skill Exists
Use human approval routing in sales and client success with emphasis on best-in-class standards, precision, and repeatable excellence.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define measurable outcomes for Human Approval Routing for sales and client success, including baseline and target metrics for sales and client success.
2. Specify structured inputs/outputs for human approval routing and validate schema contract edge cases.
3. Implement the core human approval routing logic with deterministic scoring and reproducible execution traces.
4. Integrate orchestration policy, routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback for autonomous execution.
5. Run unit, integration, simulation, and regression suites for Human Approval Routing for sales and client success under professional mastery conditions.
6. Roll out behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry, and refine thresholds using observed operational outcomes.

## Operational Runbook
Preflight:
- Validate mission scope, contracts, and required inputs.
- Verify feature flag posture, dependencies, and approval prerequisites.

Execution:
- Execute human approval routing workflow with deterministic scoring and trace capture.
- Track posture transitions and preserve reproducible evidence artifacts.

Recovery:
- Apply rollback strategy if posture is critical or guardrails fail.
- Escalate blocked execution to oversight with incident packet and trace references.

Handoff:
- Publish outcome report, scorecard, and telemetry links.
- Queue follow-up tasks for unresolved risks, approvals, or optimization work.

## Guardrails
- [quality] Require unit and integration validations before promoting Human Approval Routing for sales and client success. -> `run-validation:unit+integration+simulation+regression-baseline`
- [reliability] Trigger rollback on critical posture or repeated failures. -> `rollback:rollback-to-last-stable-baseline`
- [cost] Respect bounded resource pressure and execution budget during scaling. -> `budget-guard:resource-pressure-cap`
