# Handoff Contracting for nonprofit program delivery

## Why This Skill Exists
Use handoff contracting in nonprofit program delivery with emphasis on best-in-class standards, precision, and repeatable excellence.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define measurable outcomes for Handoff Contracting for nonprofit program delivery, including baseline and target metrics for nonprofit program delivery.
2. Specify structured inputs/outputs for handoff contracting and validate schema contract edge cases.
3. Implement the core handoff contracting logic with deterministic scoring and reproducible execution traces.
4. Integrate orchestration policy, routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback for autonomous execution.
5. Run unit, integration, simulation, and regression suites for Handoff Contracting for nonprofit program delivery under professional mastery conditions.
6. Roll out behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry, and refine thresholds using observed operational outcomes.

## Operational Runbook
Preflight:
- Validate mission scope, contracts, and required inputs.
- Verify feature flag posture, dependencies, and approval prerequisites.

Execution:
- Execute handoff contracting workflow with deterministic scoring and trace capture.
- Track posture transitions and preserve reproducible evidence artifacts.

Recovery:
- Apply rollback strategy if posture is critical or guardrails fail.
- Escalate blocked execution to oversight with incident packet and trace references.

Handoff:
- Publish outcome report, scorecard, and telemetry links.
- Queue follow-up tasks for unresolved risks, approvals, or optimization work.

## Guardrails
- [quality] Require unit and integration validations before promoting Handoff Contracting for nonprofit program delivery. -> `run-validation:unit+integration+simulation+regression-baseline`
- [reliability] Trigger rollback on critical posture or repeated failures. -> `rollback:rollback-to-last-stable-baseline`
- [cost] Respect bounded resource pressure and execution budget during scaling. -> `budget-guard:resource-pressure-cap`
