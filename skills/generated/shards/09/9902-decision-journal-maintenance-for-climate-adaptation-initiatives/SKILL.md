# Decision Journal Maintenance for climate adaptation initiatives

## Why This Skill Exists
Use decision journal maintenance in climate adaptation initiatives with emphasis on safety, dignity, equity, and long-term societal benefit.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define measurable outcomes for Decision Journal Maintenance for climate adaptation initiatives, including baseline and target metrics for climate adaptation initiatives.
2. Specify structured inputs/outputs for decision journal maintenance and validate schema contract edge cases.
3. Implement the core decision journal maintenance logic with deterministic scoring and reproducible execution traces.
4. Integrate orchestration policy, routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback for autonomous execution.
5. Run unit, integration, simulation, and regression suites for Decision Journal Maintenance for climate adaptation initiatives under pro-humanity impact conditions.
6. Roll out behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry, and refine thresholds using observed operational outcomes.

## Operational Runbook
Preflight:
- Validate mission scope, contracts, and required inputs.
- Verify feature flag posture, dependencies, and approval prerequisites.

Execution:
- Execute decision journal maintenance workflow with deterministic scoring and trace capture.
- Track posture transitions and preserve reproducible evidence artifacts.

Recovery:
- Apply rollback strategy if posture is critical or guardrails fail.
- Escalate blocked execution to oversight with incident packet and trace references.

Handoff:
- Publish outcome report, scorecard, and telemetry links.
- Queue follow-up tasks for unresolved risks, approvals, or optimization work.

## Guardrails
- [quality] Require unit and integration validations before promoting Decision Journal Maintenance for climate adaptation initiatives. -> `run-validation:unit+integration+simulation+regression-baseline`
- [reliability] Trigger rollback on critical posture or repeated failures. -> `rollback:rollback-to-last-stable-baseline`
- [cost] Respect bounded resource pressure and execution budget during scaling. -> `budget-guard:resource-pressure-cap`
