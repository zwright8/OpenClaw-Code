# Community Feedback Harvesting for disaster response networks

## Why This Skill Exists
Use community feedback harvesting in disaster response networks with emphasis on safety, dignity, equity, and long-term societal benefit.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define measurable outcomes for Community Feedback Harvesting for disaster response networks, including baseline and target metrics for disaster response networks.
2. Specify structured inputs/outputs for community feedback harvesting and validate schema contract edge cases.
3. Implement the core community feedback harvesting logic with deterministic scoring and reproducible execution traces.
4. Integrate orchestration policy, routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback for autonomous execution.
5. Run unit, integration, simulation, and regression suites for Community Feedback Harvesting for disaster response networks under pro-humanity impact conditions.
6. Roll out behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry, and refine thresholds using observed operational outcomes.

## Operational Runbook
Preflight:
- Validate mission scope, contracts, and required inputs.
- Verify feature flag posture, dependencies, and approval prerequisites.

Execution:
- Execute community feedback harvesting workflow with deterministic scoring and trace capture.
- Track posture transitions and preserve reproducible evidence artifacts.

Recovery:
- Apply rollback strategy if posture is critical or guardrails fail.
- Escalate blocked execution to oversight with incident packet and trace references.

Handoff:
- Publish outcome report, scorecard, and telemetry links.
- Queue follow-up tasks for unresolved risks, approvals, or optimization work.

## Guardrails
- [quality] Require unit and integration validations before promoting Community Feedback Harvesting for disaster response networks. -> `run-validation:unit+integration+simulation+regression-baseline`
- [reliability] Trigger rollback on critical posture or repeated failures. -> `rollback:rollback-to-last-stable-baseline`
- [compliance] Require policy and approval gates prior to autonomous deployment. -> `approval-gates:policy-constraint-check+human-impact-review`
- [safety] Block production action when risk posture is critical until human oversight review. -> `open-incident:human-oversight`
