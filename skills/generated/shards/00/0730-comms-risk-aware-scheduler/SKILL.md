# Comms Risk-Aware Scheduler

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because complex systems require explanations humans can act on quickly. This specific skill times execution based on risk posture instead of urgency alone.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Comms Risk-Aware Scheduler" outcomes in the Communication and Explainability domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Comms Risk-Aware Scheduler`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to misinterpretation and trust erosion.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for decision factors, uncertainty markers, and audience summaries, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using risk-weighted sequencing, and produce risk-gated schedules with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover misinterpretation and trust erosion, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Deterministic Workflow Notes
- Core method: risk-weighted sequencing
- Archetype: planning-router
- Routing tag: communication-and-explainability:planning-router

## Input Contract
- `decision factors` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `uncertainty markers` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `audience summaries` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `claims` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `evidence` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `confidence traces` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)

## Output Contract
- `risk_gated_schedules_report` (structured-report, consumer=orchestrator, guaranteed=true)
- `risk_gated_schedules_scorecard` (scorecard, consumer=operator, guaranteed=true)

## Validation Gates
1. **schema-contract-check** — All required input signals present and schema-valid (on fail: quarantine)
2. **determinism-check** — Repeated run on same inputs yields stable scoring and artifacts (on fail: escalate)
3. **policy-approval-check** — Approval gates satisfied before publish-level outputs (on fail: retry)

## Failure Handling
- `E_INPUT_SCHEMA`: Missing or malformed required signals → Reject payload, emit validation error, request corrected payload
- `E_NON_DETERMINISM`: Determinism delta exceeds allowed threshold → Freeze output, escalate to human approval router
- `E_DEPENDENCY_TIMEOUT`: Downstream or external dependency timeout → Apply retry policy then rollback to last stable baseline
- Rollback strategy: rollback-to-last-stable-baseline

## Handoff Contract
- Produces: Comms Risk-Aware Scheduler normalized artifacts; execution scorecard; risk posture
- Consumes: decision factors; uncertainty markers; audience summaries; claims; evidence; confidence traces
- Downstream routing hint: Route next to communication-and-explainability:planning-router consumers with approval-gate context

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Orchestration integration: task routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit tests, integration tests, simulation checks, and rollout telemetry.

## Trigger Checklist
- [ ] The request explicitly needs **Comms Risk-Aware Scheduler** outcomes (not generic brainstorming).
- [ ] Inputs are sufficient to execute in **workflows** with measurable acceptance criteria.
- [ ] A downstream consumer is identified for the output artifacts (operator/orchestrator/audit log).
- [ ] If any item is false, route to discovery/scoping first instead of invoking this skill.

## Operational Cadence (Day / Week / Month)
- **Daily:** Run when new workflows signals arrive or when active decisions depend on this capability.
- **Weekly:** Review thresholds, drift, and failure telemetry; calibrate decision rules and retry policy.
- **Monthly:** Re-baseline deterministic expectations, archive evidence, and refresh approval/handoff assumptions.

## Practical Usage Examples
1. **Incident stabilization in workflows**
   - Input: noisy upstream payload requiring comms risk-aware scheduler normalization/assessment.
   - Expected output: schema-valid artifact bundle + scorecard + explicit next-hop routing hint.
   - Handoff: orchestrator receives deterministic result package for gated downstream execution.
2. **Planned delivery quality check**
   - Input: scheduled batch with known baseline and acceptance metrics.
   - Expected output: pass/fail gate results, variance notes, and publish/no-publish recommendation.
   - Handoff: operator receives execution summary with risk/confidence and approval requirements.

## Anti-Patterns (Do Not Use)
- Do **not** use for open-ended ideation where success metrics and contracts are undefined.
- Do **not** bypass schema/policy gates to force output publication under time pressure.
- Do **not** treat non-deterministic or partial outputs as release-ready artifacts.
- Do **not** invoke this skill when a different capability family is the true bottleneck.
