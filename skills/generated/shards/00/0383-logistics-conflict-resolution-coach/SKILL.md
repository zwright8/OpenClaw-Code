# Logistics Conflict Resolution Coach

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because impact work fails when scarce resources are not routed intelligently. This specific skill reduces deadlocks in human-agent collaboration loops.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Logistics Conflict Resolution Coach" outcomes in the Resource Allocation and Logistics domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Logistics Conflict Resolution Coach`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to supply shortfalls and fairness gaps.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for capacity, bottlenecks, and distribution plans, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using guided mediation prompts, and produce conflict remediation playbooks with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover supply shortfalls and fairness gaps, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Deterministic Workflow Notes
- Core method: guided mediation prompts
- Archetype: collaboration-mediator
- Routing tag: resource-allocation-and-logistics:collaboration-mediator

## Input Contract
- `capacity` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `bottlenecks` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `distribution plans` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `claims` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `evidence` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `confidence traces` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)

## Output Contract
- `conflict_remediation_playbooks_report` (structured-report, consumer=orchestrator, guaranteed=true)
- `conflict_remediation_playbooks_scorecard` (scorecard, consumer=operator, guaranteed=true)

## Validation Gates
1. **schema-contract-check** — All required input signals present and schema-valid (on fail: quarantine)
2. **determinism-check** — Repeated run on same inputs yields stable scoring and artifacts (on fail: escalate)
3. **policy-approval-check** — Approval gates satisfied before publish-level outputs (on fail: retry)

## Failure Handling
- `E_INPUT_SCHEMA`: Missing or malformed required signals → Reject payload, emit validation error, request corrected payload
- `E_NON_DETERMINISM`: Determinism delta exceeds allowed threshold → Freeze output, escalate to human approval router
- `E_DEPENDENCY_TIMEOUT`: Downstream or external dependency timeout → Apply retry policy then rollback to last stable baseline
- Rollback strategy: rollback-to-last-stable-baseline

## Handoff Contract
- Produces: Logistics Conflict Resolution Coach normalized artifacts; execution scorecard; risk posture
- Consumes: capacity; bottlenecks; distribution plans; claims; evidence; confidence traces
- Downstream routing hint: Route next to resource-allocation-and-logistics:collaboration-mediator consumers with approval-gate context

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Orchestration integration: task routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit tests, integration tests, simulation checks, and rollout telemetry.

## Production Trigger Clarity
- Use only when this capability produces production-facing outcomes with measurable acceptance criteria.
- Do not invoke for exploratory brainstorming or unrelated domains; route those requests to the correct capability family.

## Deterministic Tolerances
- Repeated runs on identical inputs must remain within **<=1% output variance** for scoring fields and preserve schema-identical artifact shape.
- Any variance beyond tolerance is a hard failure and must trigger escalation.

## Fail-Closed Validation Gates
1. Schema validity gate (required inputs present and valid).
2. Determinism gate (variance within tolerance).
3. Policy/approval gate (required approvals satisfied).

If any gate fails: **block output publication and fail closed**.

## High-Risk Human Sign-Off
- Any high-risk change, policy-impacting output, or publish-level action requires explicit human sign-off before release.
- Missing sign-off is a blocking condition.

## Explicit Handoff Contract
- **Produces:** normalized artifacts, decision scorecard, risk/confidence metadata.
- **Consumes:** validated upstream inputs for this capability.
- **Next hop:** route only to declared downstream consumers with gate/approval context attached.


## Trigger Checklist
- [ ] The request explicitly needs **Logistics Conflict Resolution Coach** outcomes (not generic brainstorming).
- [ ] Inputs are sufficient to execute in **Resource Allocation and Logistics** with measurable acceptance criteria.
- [ ] A downstream consumer is identified for the output artifacts (operator/orchestrator/audit log).
- [ ] If any item is false, route to discovery/scoping first instead of invoking this skill.

## Operational Cadence (Day / Week / Month)
- **Daily:** Run when new resource allocation and logistics signals arrive or when active decisions depend on this capability.
- **Weekly:** Review thresholds, drift, and failure telemetry; calibrate decision rules and retry policy.
- **Monthly:** Re-baseline deterministic expectations, archive evidence, and refresh approval/handoff assumptions.

## Practical Usage Examples
1. **Incident stabilization in Resource Allocation and Logistics**
   - Input: noisy upstream payload requiring logistics conflict resolution coach normalization/assessment.
   - Expected output: schema-valid artifact bundle + scorecard + explicit next-hop routing hint.
   - Handoff: orchestrator receives deterministic result package for gated downstream execution.
2. **Planned delivery quality check**
   - Input: scheduled batch with known baseline and acceptance metrics.
   - Expected output: pass/fail gate results, variance notes, and publish/no-publish recommendation.
   - Handoff: operator receives execution summary with risk/confidence and approval requirements.

## Anti-Patterns (Do Not Use)
- Do **not** use for open-ended ideation where success metrics and contracts are undefined.
- Do **not** bypass schema/policy gates to force output publication under time pressure.
- Do **not** treat non-deterministic or partial outputs as release-ready artifacts.
- Do **not** invoke this skill when a different capability family is the true bottleneck.
