# Security Semantic Retrieval Ranker

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because production autonomy must default to least privilege and strong privacy. This specific skill improves recall precision for downstream decision quality.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Security Semantic Retrieval Ranker" outcomes in the Security and Privacy domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Security Semantic Retrieval Ranker`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to breach, exfiltration, and over-privileged actions.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for permissions, sensitive data flows, and threat events, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using semantic relevance scoring, and produce ranked retrieval results with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover breach, exfiltration, and over-privileged actions, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Deterministic Workflow Notes
- Core method: semantic relevance scoring
- Archetype: planning-router
- Routing tag: security-and-privacy:planning-router

## Input Contract
- `permissions` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `sensitive data flows` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `threat events` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `claims` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `evidence` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `confidence traces` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)

## Output Contract
- `ranked_retrieval_results_report` (structured-report, consumer=orchestrator, guaranteed=true)
- `ranked_retrieval_results_scorecard` (scorecard, consumer=operator, guaranteed=true)

## Validation Gates
1. **schema-contract-check** — All required input signals present and schema-valid (on fail: quarantine)
2. **determinism-check** — Repeated run on same inputs yields stable scoring and artifacts (on fail: escalate)
3. **policy-approval-check** — Approval gates satisfied before publish-level outputs (on fail: retry)

## Failure Handling
- `E_INPUT_SCHEMA`: Missing or malformed required signals → Reject payload, emit validation error, request corrected payload
- `E_NON_DETERMINISM`: Determinism delta exceeds allowed threshold → Freeze output, escalate to human approval router
- `E_DEPENDENCY_TIMEOUT`: Downstream or external dependency timeout → Apply retry policy then rollback to last stable baseline
- Rollback strategy: rollback-to-last-stable-baseline

## Handoff Contract
- Produces: Security Semantic Retrieval Ranker normalized artifacts; execution scorecard; risk posture
- Consumes: permissions; sensitive data flows; threat events; claims; evidence; confidence traces
- Downstream routing hint: Route next to security-and-privacy:planning-router consumers with approval-gate context

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Orchestration integration: task routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit tests, integration tests, simulation checks, and rollout telemetry.

## Trigger Checklist
- [ ] The request explicitly needs **Security Semantic Retrieval Ranker** outcomes (not generic brainstorming).
- [ ] Inputs are sufficient to execute in **workflows** with measurable acceptance criteria.
- [ ] A downstream consumer is identified for the output artifacts (operator/orchestrator/audit log).
- [ ] If any item is false, route to discovery/scoping first instead of invoking this skill.

## Operational Cadence (Day / Week / Month)
- **Daily:** Run when new workflows signals arrive or when active decisions depend on this capability.
- **Weekly:** Review thresholds, drift, and failure telemetry; calibrate decision rules and retry policy.
- **Monthly:** Re-baseline deterministic expectations, archive evidence, and refresh approval/handoff assumptions.

## Practical Usage Examples
1. **Incident stabilization in workflows**
   - Input: noisy upstream payload requiring security semantic retrieval ranker normalization/assessment.
   - Expected output: schema-valid artifact bundle + scorecard + explicit next-hop routing hint.
   - Handoff: orchestrator receives deterministic result package for gated downstream execution.
2. **Planned delivery quality check**
   - Input: scheduled batch with known baseline and acceptance metrics.
   - Expected output: pass/fail gate results, variance notes, and publish/no-publish recommendation.
   - Handoff: operator receives execution summary with risk/confidence and approval requirements.

## Anti-Patterns (Do Not Use)
- Do **not** use for open-ended ideation where success metrics and contracts are undefined.
- Do **not** bypass schema/policy gates to force output publication under time pressure.
- Do **not** treat non-deterministic or partial outputs as release-ready artifacts.
- Do **not** invoke this skill when a different capability family is the true bottleneck.
