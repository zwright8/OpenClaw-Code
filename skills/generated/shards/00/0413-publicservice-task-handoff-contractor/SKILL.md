- [ ] Inputs are sufficient and source provenance is available.
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable and agreed before execution.
- [ ] A downstream owner/consumer for handoff is identified.
- [ ] If risk is high, human approval path is available before publish.

|---|---|---|---|
| protocol checks | signal | yes | upstream/operator |
| service queues | signal | yes | upstream/operator |
| compliance flags | signal | yes | upstream/operator |
| claims | signal | yes | upstream/operator |
| evidence | signal | yes | upstream/operator |
| confidence traces | signal | yes | upstream/operator |

## Outputs (contract)
| Output | Type | Guaranteed | Consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| typed handoff artifacts | structured-artifact | yes | downstream orchestrator |
| typed handoff artifacts-scorecard | scorecard | yes | operator / reviewer |

## Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `PublicService Task Handoff Contractor`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to service harm and procedural violations.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for protocol checks, service queues, and compliance flags, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using contracted payload schemas, and produce typed handoff artifacts with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover service harm and procedural violations, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Operational Runbook
### Preflight
- Confirm scope, owner, and success criteria for PublicService Task Handoff Contractor.

### Execution
- Execute contracted payload schemas deterministically and capture reproducible traces.

### Recovery
- Apply retry policy then rollback-to-last-stable-baseline when posture remains critical.

### Handoff
- Publish artifact bundle, scorecard, and next actions with clear ownership.

## Operator Use Cases
- Operate PublicService Task Handoff Contractor as a reliable, reusable production workflow.

## Guardrail Policy Matrix
| Guardrail Type | Policy Rule | Automation Hook |
|---|---|---|
| general | Enforce deterministic quality and policy constraints. | validation+approval gates |

## Posture Playbook
- **Ready posture (score >= 75):** release artifacts after validation pass and route to `healthcare-and-public-services:contract-compiler`.
- **Review posture (score >= 54 or risk >= 53):** require human review before publish, with explicit remediation notes.
- **Critical posture (risk >= 79):** fail closed, execute `rollback-to-last-stable-baseline`, and escalate with incident packet.

## Traceability Map
- **Scope:** Define the scope and success metrics for `PublicService Task Handoff Contractor`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to service harm and procedural violations.
- **Contract:** Design and version the input/output contract for protocol checks, service queues, and compliance flags, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
- **Core:** Implement the core capability using contracted payload schemas, and produce typed handoff artifacts with deterministic scoring.
- **Orchestration:** Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
- **Validation:** Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover service harm and procedural violations, then run regression baselines.
- **Rollout:** Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Decision & Scoring Policy
- Scoring weights: `truth=0.13, execution=0.14, safety=0.37, impact=0.36`
- Posture thresholds:
  - `ready`: score >= 75
  - `review`: score >= 54
  - `review_risk`: risk >= 53
  - `critical_risk`: risk >= 79
- Retry policy: max attempts `4`, base delay `1050ms`, backoff `exponential`.
- Approval gates: `policy-constraint-check`, `human-approval-router`, `safety-review`.

## Validation Gates & Test Matrix
| Gate | Purpose | On Fail |
|---|---|---|
| schema-contract-check | Ensure required inputs and contract shape are valid. | block release |
| determinism-check | Replay identical input and compare output hash/score delta. | escalate + quarantine |
| policy-approval-check | Verify policy constraints and approval tokens. | block publish |
| reliability-check | Validate retry budget and rollback readiness. | rollback to stable baseline |

- Required validation suites: unit, integration, simulation, regression-baseline

## Failure Modes & Recovery Playbook
- `E_INPUT_SCHEMA`: required signal missing or malformed -> reject payload and request corrected input.
- `E_NON_DETERMINISM`: replay mismatch or unstable score delta -> quarantine output and escalate for human review.
- `E_POLICY_BLOCK`: approval/policy gate unsatisfied -> keep publish blocked until explicit approval is attached.
- `E_DEPENDENCY_TIMEOUT`: transient timeout -> apply retry budget; if unresolved, execute `rollback-to-last-stable-baseline` and issue incident packet.

## Human Approval & Escalation
- High-risk or policy-sensitive runs require an explicit approval token before release.
- Escalate to human reviewer when any gate fails twice or critical risk posture is reached.
- Escalation packet must include: scope, failed gate, evidence links, retry history, and recommended decision.

## External Tool Stack Recommendation
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Recommendation class | `hybrid` |
| Migration priority | `P1` |
| External auth required | `yes` |
| API key likely required | `yes` |
| Rationale | Use external systems for persistence/enforcement/math and frontier models for synthesis and language-heavy reasoning. |

| Service | Why in stack | Auth mode | Auth required | API key likely |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frontier model runtime | reasoning and synthesis | model provider credentials | yes | yes |
| Task/workflow orchestrator | durable execution and retries | account/session credentials | yes | no |
| Telemetry store | evidence and observability | account/session credentials | yes | no |
| Audit log + immutable storage | compliance-grade evidence retention | account/session credentials | yes | no |

## Tool Inventory Highlights
| Tool | Role in execution | Call pattern | Mutating |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frontier model runtime | reasoning and synthesis | model inference | no |
| Task/workflow orchestrator | durable execution and retries | read+write | yes |
| Telemetry store | evidence and observability | read+write | yes |
| Audit log + immutable storage | compliance-grade evidence retention | read/query | no |

## API Protocols & Credential Requirements
| Tool | Primary protocol(s) | Auth mode | Auth required | API key needed | Operator action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frontier model runtime | HTTPS/REST | model provider credentials | yes | yes | Check existing API key first; validate with lightweight auth request; prompt only if missing/invalid/expired. |
| Task/workflow orchestrator | HTTPS/REST, gRPC | account/session credentials | yes | no | Reuse current account/session credentials; validate context before execution. |
| Telemetry store | HTTPS/REST, OTLP or SQL | account/session credentials | yes | no | Reuse current account/session credentials; validate context before execution. |
| Audit log + immutable storage | HTTPS/REST | account/session credentials | yes | no | Reuse current account/session credentials; validate context before execution. |

## Tool Call Implementation
- Use the following deterministic call sequence for this skill:
1. `Frontier model runtime` -> auth preflight, execute model inference call(s), normalize output, and attach trace to `typed handoff artifacts`.
2. `Task/workflow orchestrator` -> auth preflight, execute read+write call(s), normalize output, and attach trace to `typed handoff artifacts`.
3. `Telemetry store` -> auth preflight, execute read+write call(s), normalize output, and attach trace to `typed handoff artifacts`.
4. `Audit log + immutable storage` -> auth preflight, execute read/query call(s), normalize output, and attach trace to `typed handoff artifacts`.
- After each call, validate schema + policy gates and preserve evidence in the handoff packet.
- If any required credential check fails, halt execution and request corrected auth context.

## External Integration Migration Checklist
- Provision service credentials and validate non-expired auth before first run.
- Wire service outputs into validation/handoff artifacts.
- Enable credential reuse; prompt user only on missing/invalid/expired credentials.

## Credential Reuse Policy
- Reuse previously provided credentials by default; do not ask for new credentials when a valid credential/session already exists.
- Before prompting, check environment/session secret stores and run lightweight auth validation.
- Ask the user for credentials only if they are missing, invalid, expired, or explicitly revoked/rotated.

## Practical Usage Examples
1. Incident recovery in Healthcare and Public Services: ingest noisy signals, execute contracted payload schemas, produce an operator-ready scorecard and remediation queue.
2. Scheduled quality pass: run PublicService Task Handoff Contractor against baseline data, compare drift, and publish release/no-release recommendation with evidence links.
3. Pre-deployment gate: validate artifacts for healthcare-and-public-services:contract-compiler, enforce approvals, then handoff to downstream orchestrator with next actions.

## Anti-Patterns
- Do not publish artifacts when any validation gate fails.
- Do not bypass approval gates for high-risk runs.
- Do not run with missing provenance, schema, or success criteria.
- Do not treat partial/non-deterministic outputs as production-ready.

## Handoff Contract
- **Produces:** `typed handoff artifacts`, scorecard, risk/confidence metadata, remediation backlog.
- **Consumes:** `protocol checks`, `service queues`, `compliance flags`, `claims`, `evidence`, `confidence traces`.
- **Readiness rule:** release only when schema, determinism, policy, and reliability gates all pass.
- **Downstream hint:** route only to `healthcare-and-public-services:contract-compiler` consumers with approval context attached.

## Observability & Continuous Improvement
- SLO: >=99.5% successful runs per 7-day window
- Error budget: <=0.5% critical failures per 7-day window
- Alert triggers:
- Trigger alerts on repeated critical posture or validation regression spikes.
- KPI focus: `service harm`, `procedural violations`, `decision drift`
- Primary outcome metric: `service harm`
- Secondary metrics: `procedural violations`, `decision drift`
- Review cadence: `weekly`
- Weekly review: tune thresholds, retries, and approval friction based on telemetry and incident learnings.
