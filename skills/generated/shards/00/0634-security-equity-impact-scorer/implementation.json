  "domain": "Security and Privacy",

  "reason": "We need this skill because production autonomy must default to least privilege and strong privacy. This specific skill exposes uneven benefit/harm distribution before rollout.",
  "implementationGuide": [
    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Security Equity Impact Scorer`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to breach, exfiltration, and over-privileged actions.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for permissions, sensitive data flows, and threat events, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using group-level impact scoring, and produce equity impact profiles with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover breach, exfiltration, and over-privileged actions, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
