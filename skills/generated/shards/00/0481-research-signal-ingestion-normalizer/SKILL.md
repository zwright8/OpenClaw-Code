# Research Signal Ingestion Normalizer

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because research throughput degrades without reproducibility and prioritization. This specific skill stabilizes noisy upstream inputs before they contaminate planning.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Research Signal Ingestion Normalizer" outcomes in the Scientific Research Systems domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Research Signal Ingestion Normalizer`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to non-reproducible results and wasted cycles.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for hypotheses, experiments, and replication evidence, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using schema mapping and validation, and produce normalized signal feeds with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover non-reproducible results and wasted cycles, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Deterministic Workflow Notes
- Core method: schema mapping and validation
- Archetype: normalization-engine
- Routing tag: scientific-research-systems:normalization-engine

## Input Contract
- `hypotheses` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `experiments` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `replication evidence` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `claims` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `evidence` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `confidence traces` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)

## Output Contract
- `normalized_signal_feeds_report` (structured-report, consumer=orchestrator, guaranteed=true)
- `normalized_signal_feeds_scorecard` (scorecard, consumer=operator, guaranteed=true)

## Validation Gates
1. **schema-contract-check** — All required input signals present and schema-valid (on fail: quarantine)
2. **determinism-check** — Repeated run on same inputs yields stable scoring and artifacts (on fail: escalate)
3. **policy-approval-check** — Approval gates satisfied before publish-level outputs (on fail: retry)

## Failure Handling
- `E_INPUT_SCHEMA`: Missing or malformed required signals → Reject payload, emit validation error, request corrected payload
- `E_NON_DETERMINISM`: Determinism delta exceeds allowed threshold → Freeze output, escalate to human approval router
- `E_DEPENDENCY_TIMEOUT`: Downstream or external dependency timeout → Apply retry policy then rollback to last stable baseline
- Rollback strategy: rollback-to-last-stable-baseline

## Handoff Contract
- Produces: Research Signal Ingestion Normalizer normalized artifacts; execution scorecard; risk posture
- Consumes: hypotheses; experiments; replication evidence; claims; evidence; confidence traces
- Downstream routing hint: Route next to scientific-research-systems:normalization-engine consumers with approval-gate context

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Orchestration integration: task routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit tests, integration tests, simulation checks, and rollout telemetry.

## Production Trigger Clarity
- Use only when this capability produces production-facing outcomes with measurable acceptance criteria.
- Do not invoke for exploratory brainstorming or unrelated domains; route those requests to the correct capability family.

## Deterministic Tolerances
- Repeated runs on identical inputs must remain within **<=1% output variance** for scoring fields and preserve schema-identical artifact shape.
- Any variance beyond tolerance is a hard failure and must trigger escalation.

## Fail-Closed Validation Gates
1. Schema validity gate (required inputs present and valid).
2. Determinism gate (variance within tolerance).
3. Policy/approval gate (required approvals satisfied).

If any gate fails: **block output publication and fail closed**.

## High-Risk Human Sign-Off
- Any high-risk change, policy-impacting output, or publish-level action requires explicit human sign-off before release.
- Missing sign-off is a blocking condition.

## Explicit Handoff Contract
- **Produces:** normalized artifacts, decision scorecard, risk/confidence metadata.
- **Consumes:** validated upstream inputs for this capability.
- **Next hop:** route only to declared downstream consumers with gate/approval context attached.
