# Governance Community Feedback Harvester

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because high-speed autonomy needs enforceable guardrails to stay aligned. This specific skill integrates lived user feedback into planning cycles.

## Production Trigger Criteria
- Trigger only when the requested outcome explicitly maps to **Governance Community Feedback Harvester** in the **Safety and Governance** capability family.
- Require a named production consumer and execution window before running (no exploratory/ad-hoc execution).
- Require complete upstream signals; if any required signal is absent, stop and return a remediation request (fail closed).

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Governance Community Feedback Harvester`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to unsafe actions and policy drift.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for policies, violations, and mitigation actions, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using feedback normalization and clustering, and produce theme-prioritized feedback digests with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover unsafe actions and policy drift, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Deterministic Workflow Constraints
- Core method: feedback normalization and clustering
- Archetype: normalization-engine
- Routing tag: safety-and-governance:normalization-engine
- Determinism tolerance: repeated runs on identical normalized inputs must keep score/output delta within **<= 0.5%**.
- Retry budget: max 4 attempts with exponential backoff; then rollback.

## Input Contract
- `policies` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `violations` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `mitigation actions` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `claims` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `evidence` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)
- `confidence traces` (signal, source=upstream, required=true)

## Output Contract
- `theme_prioritized_feedback_digests_report` (structured-report, consumer=orchestrator, guaranteed=true)
- `theme_prioritized_feedback_digests_scorecard` (scorecard, consumer=operator, guaranteed=true)

## Validation Gates (Fail-Closed)
1. **schema-contract-check** — Reject execution unless all required inputs are present and schema-valid (on fail: quarantine + remediation request).
2. **determinism-check** — Re-run fixed test vector; block publish-level output if variance exceeds 0.5% (on fail: escalate + hold).
3. **policy-approval-check** — Enforce policy gates before any publish-level artifact (on fail: block).
4. **high-risk-human-signoff** — If risk >= critical threshold or policy marks high-impact, require explicit human approval before release (on fail: block).

## Failure Handling
- `E_INPUT_SCHEMA`: Missing or malformed required signals → Reject payload, emit validation error, request corrected payload
- `E_NON_DETERMINISM`: Determinism delta exceeds allowed threshold → Freeze output, escalate to human approval router
- `E_DEPENDENCY_TIMEOUT`: Downstream or external dependency timeout → Apply retry policy then rollback to last stable baseline
- Rollback strategy: rollback-to-last-stable-baseline

## Handoff Contract
- Produces: Governance Community Feedback Harvester normalized artifacts; execution scorecard; risk posture
- Consumes: policies; violations; mitigation actions; claims; evidence; confidence traces
- Downstream routing hint: Route next to safety-and-governance:normalization-engine consumers with approval-gate context

## Immediate Hardening Additions (Required Before Promotion)
- Add/refresh fixture file: `fixtures/golden-input.json` with deterministic sample payload and expected checksum.
- Add/refresh regression case: `tests/regression-case.md` for highest-risk failure path and expected fail-closed behavior.
- Emit machine-readable run summary to `hardening-summary.json` with fields: `status`, `risk_score`, `confidence`, `next_handoff`, `human_signoff_required`.
- Do not emit publish-level outputs when any validation gate fails.

## Production Trigger Clarity
- Use only when this capability produces production-facing outcomes with measurable acceptance criteria.
- Do not invoke for exploratory brainstorming or unrelated domains; route those requests to the correct capability family.

## Deterministic Tolerances
- Repeated runs on identical inputs must remain within **<=1% output variance** for scoring fields and preserve schema-identical artifact shape.
- Any variance beyond tolerance is a hard failure and must trigger escalation.

## Fail-Closed Validation Gates
1. Schema validity gate (required inputs present and valid).
2. Determinism gate (variance within tolerance).
3. Policy/approval gate (required approvals satisfied).

If any gate fails: **block output publication and fail closed**.

## High-Risk Human Sign-Off
- Any high-risk change, policy-impacting output, or publish-level action requires explicit human sign-off before release.
- Missing sign-off is a blocking condition.

## Explicit Handoff Contract
- **Produces:** normalized artifacts, decision scorecard, risk/confidence metadata.
- **Consumes:** validated upstream inputs for this capability.
- **Next hop:** route only to declared downstream consumers with gate/approval context attached.
