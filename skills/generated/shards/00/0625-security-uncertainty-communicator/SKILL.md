## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because production autonomy must default to least privilege and strong privacy. This specific skill prevents overstatement by explicitly framing uncertainty.

## Trigger Checklist
- [ ] The task explicitly needs Security Uncertainty Communicator (not generic brainstorming).
- [ ] Inputs are sufficient and source provenance is available.
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable and agreed before execution.
- [ ] A downstream owner/consumer for handoff is identified.
- [ ] If risk is high, human approval path is available before publish.

## Inputs (contract)
| Input | Type | Required | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| permissions | signal | yes | upstream/operator |
| sensitive data flows | signal | yes | upstream/operator |
| threat events | signal | yes | upstream/operator |
| claims | signal | yes | upstream/operator |
| evidence | signal | yes | upstream/operator |
| confidence traces | signal | yes | upstream/operator |

## Outputs (contract)
| Output | Type | Guaranteed | Consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| uncertainty briefs | structured-artifact | yes | downstream orchestrator |
| uncertainty briefs-scorecard | scorecard | yes | operator / reviewer |
| uncertainty briefs-handoff | handoff-packet | yes | next owner |

## Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Security Uncertainty Communicator`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to breach, exfiltration, and over-privileged actions.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for permissions, sensitive data flows, and threat events, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using confidence-bound communication templates, and produce uncertainty briefs with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover breach, exfiltration, and over-privileged actions, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Operational Runbook
### Preflight
- Confirm scope, owner, and success criteria for Security Uncertainty Communicator.

### Execution
- Execute confidence-bound communication templates deterministically and capture reproducible traces.

### Recovery
- Apply retry policy then rollback-to-last-stable-baseline when posture remains critical.

### Handoff
- Publish artifact bundle, scorecard, and next actions with clear ownership.

## Operator Use Cases
- Operate Security Uncertainty Communicator as a reliable, reusable production workflow.

## Guardrail Policy Matrix
| Guardrail Type | Policy Rule | Automation Hook |
|---|---|---|
| general | Enforce deterministic quality and policy constraints. | validation+approval gates |

## Posture Playbook
- **Ready posture (score >= 71):** release artifacts after validation pass and route to `security-and-privacy:communication-engine`.
- **Review posture (score >= 43 or risk >= 36):** require human review before publish, with explicit remediation notes.
- **Critical posture (risk >= 68):** fail closed, execute `rollback-to-last-stable-baseline`, and escalate with incident packet.

## Traceability Map
- **Scope:** Define the scope and success metrics for `Security Uncertainty Communicator`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to breach, exfiltration, and over-privileged actions.
- **Contract:** Design and version the input/output contract for permissions, sensitive data flows, and threat events, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
- **Core:** Implement the core capability using confidence-bound communication templates, and produce uncertainty briefs with deterministic scoring.
- **Orchestration:** Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
- **Validation:** Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover breach, exfiltration, and over-privileged actions, then run regression baselines.
- **Rollout:** Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Decision & Scoring Policy
- Scoring weights: `truth=0.20, execution=0.20, safety=0.31, impact=0.29`
- Posture thresholds:
  - `ready`: score >= 71
  - `review`: score >= 43
  - `review_risk`: risk >= 36
  - `critical_risk`: risk >= 68
- Retry policy: max attempts `4`, base delay `600ms`, backoff `exponential`.
- Approval gates: `policy-constraint-check`, `human-approval-router`, `security-review`.

## Validation Gates & Test Matrix
| Gate | Purpose | On Fail |
|---|---|---|
| schema-contract-check | Ensure required inputs and contract shape are valid. | block release |
| determinism-check | Replay identical input and compare output hash/score delta. | escalate + quarantine |
| policy-approval-check | Verify policy constraints and approval tokens. | block publish |
| reliability-check | Validate retry budget and rollback readiness. | rollback to stable baseline |

- Required validation suites: unit, integration, simulation, regression-baseline

## Failure Modes & Recovery Playbook
- `E_INPUT_SCHEMA`: required signal missing or malformed -> reject payload and request corrected input.
- `E_NON_DETERMINISM`: replay mismatch or unstable score delta -> quarantine output and escalate for human review.
- `E_POLICY_BLOCK`: approval/policy gate unsatisfied -> keep publish blocked until explicit approval is attached.
- `E_DEPENDENCY_TIMEOUT`: transient timeout -> apply retry budget; if unresolved, execute `rollback-to-last-stable-baseline` and issue incident packet.

## Human Approval & Escalation
- High-risk or policy-sensitive runs require an explicit approval token before release.
- Escalate to human reviewer when any gate fails twice or critical risk posture is reached.
- Escalation packet must include: scope, failed gate, evidence links, retry history, and recommended decision.

## External Tool Stack Recommendation
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Recommendation class | `model-primary` |
| Migration priority | `P2` |
| External auth required | `yes` |
| API key likely required | `yes` |
| Rationale | Primary value is language reasoning/communication; external services are optional accelerators. |

| Service | Why in stack | Auth mode | Auth required | API key likely |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frontier model runtime | primary synthesis, tone, and judgment | model provider credentials | yes | yes |
| Vector memory store (optional) | long-term retrieval augmentation | account/session credentials | maybe | no |
| Audit log + immutable storage | compliance-grade evidence retention | account/session credentials | yes | no |

## Tool Inventory Highlights
| Tool | Role in execution | Call pattern | Mutating |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frontier model runtime | primary synthesis, tone, and judgment | model inference | no |
| Vector memory store (optional) | long-term retrieval augmentation | read/query | no |
| Audit log + immutable storage | compliance-grade evidence retention | read/query | no |

## API Protocols & Credential Requirements
| Tool | Primary protocol(s) | Auth mode | Auth required | API key needed | Operator action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Frontier model runtime | HTTPS/REST | model provider credentials | yes | yes | Check existing API key first; validate with lightweight auth request; prompt only if missing/invalid/expired. |
| Vector memory store (optional) | HTTPS/REST or local runtime | account/session credentials | maybe | no | Reuse current account/session credentials; validate context before execution. |
| Audit log + immutable storage | HTTPS/REST | account/session credentials | yes | no | Reuse current account/session credentials; validate context before execution. |

## Tool Call Implementation
- Use the following deterministic call sequence for this skill:
1. `Frontier model runtime` -> auth preflight, execute model inference call(s), normalize output, and attach trace to `uncertainty briefs`.
2. `Vector memory store (optional)` -> auth preflight, execute read/query call(s), normalize output, and attach trace to `uncertainty briefs`.
3. `Audit log + immutable storage` -> auth preflight, execute read/query call(s), normalize output, and attach trace to `uncertainty briefs`.
- After each call, validate schema + policy gates and preserve evidence in the handoff packet.
- If any required credential check fails, halt execution and request corrected auth context.

## External Integration Migration Checklist
- Provision service credentials and validate non-expired auth before first run.
- Wire service outputs into validation/handoff artifacts.
- Enable credential reuse; prompt user only on missing/invalid/expired credentials.

## Credential Reuse Policy
- Reuse previously provided credentials by default; do not ask for new credentials when a valid credential/session already exists.
- Before prompting, check environment/session secret stores and run lightweight auth validation.
- Ask the user for credentials only if they are missing, invalid, expired, or explicitly revoked/rotated.

## Practical Usage Examples
1. Incident recovery in Security and Privacy: ingest noisy signals, execute confidence-bound communication templates, produce an operator-ready scorecard and remediation queue.
2. Scheduled quality pass: run Security Uncertainty Communicator against baseline data, compare drift, and publish release/no-release recommendation with evidence links.
3. Pre-deployment gate: validate artifacts for security-and-privacy:communication-engine, enforce approvals, then handoff to downstream orchestrator with next actions.

## Anti-Patterns
- Do not publish artifacts when any validation gate fails.
- Do not bypass approval gates for high-risk runs.
- Do not run with missing provenance, schema, or success criteria.
- Do not treat partial/non-deterministic outputs as production-ready.

## Handoff Contract
- **Produces:** `uncertainty briefs`, scorecard, risk/confidence metadata, remediation backlog.
- **Consumes:** `permissions`, `sensitive data flows`, `threat events`, `claims`, `evidence`, `confidence traces`.
- **Readiness rule:** release only when schema, determinism, policy, and reliability gates all pass.
- **Downstream hint:** route only to `security-and-privacy:communication-engine` consumers with approval context attached.

## Observability & Continuous Improvement
- SLO: >=99.5% successful runs per 7-day window
- Error budget: <=0.5% critical failures per 7-day window
- Alert triggers:
- Trigger alerts on repeated critical posture or validation regression spikes.
- KPI focus: `breach`, `exfiltration`, `over-privileged actions`
- Primary outcome metric: `breach`
- Secondary metrics: `exfiltration`, `over-privileged actions`
- Review cadence: `weekly`
- Weekly review: tune thresholds, retries, and approval friction based on telemetry and incident learnings.
