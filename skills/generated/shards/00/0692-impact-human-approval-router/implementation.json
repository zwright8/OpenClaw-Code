    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Impact Human Approval Router`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to impact theater and unmeasured harm.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for community outcomes, KPI trends, and intervention deltas, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using reviewer routing policies, and produce priority approval queues with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover impact theater and unmeasured harm, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
