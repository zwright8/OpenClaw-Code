    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Community Failure Root-Cause Miner`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to community trust loss and unaddressed concerns.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for feedback channels, sentiment, urgency, and follow-ups, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using error pattern mining, and produce root-cause clusters with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover community trust loss and unaddressed concerns, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
