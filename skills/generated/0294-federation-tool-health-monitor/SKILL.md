# Federation Tool Health Monitor

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because cross-org collaboration fails without shared contracts and trust primitives. This specific skill detects tool flakiness before it impacts mission outcomes.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Federation Tool Health Monitor" outcomes in the Federation and Interoperability domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Federation Tool Health Monitor`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to integration breakage and trust boundary violations.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for envelopes, tenant boundaries, and protocol bridges, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using telemetry aggregation and SLO checks, and produce tool reliability scores with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover integration breakage and trust boundary violations, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Orchestration integration: task routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit tests, integration tests, simulation checks, and rollout telemetry.
