# Education Resource Budget Allocator

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because human capability growth requires targeted planning under constraints. This specific skill matches mission ambition to finite execution capacity.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Education Resource Budget Allocator" outcomes in the Education and Upskilling domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Education Resource Budget Allocator`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to persistent skill gaps and poor learning outcomes.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for skill profiles, learning paths, and support resources, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using capacity-aware allocation, and produce budgeted execution plans with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover persistent skill gaps and poor learning outcomes, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Orchestration integration: task routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit tests, integration tests, simulation checks, and rollout telemetry.
