  "domain": "Healthcare and Public Services",

  "reason": "We need this skill because public-facing workflows require strict safety and reliability controls. This specific skill detects tool flakiness before it impacts mission outcomes.",

    "Define the scope and success metrics for `PublicService Tool Health Monitor`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to service harm and procedural violations.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for protocol checks, service queues, and compliance flags, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using telemetry aggregation and SLO checks, and produce tool reliability scores with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover service harm and procedural violations, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
