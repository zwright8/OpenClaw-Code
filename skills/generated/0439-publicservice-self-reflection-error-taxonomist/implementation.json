    "Define the scope and success metrics for `PublicService Self-Reflection Error Taxonomist`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to service harm and procedural violations.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for protocol checks, service queues, and compliance flags, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using failure-type clustering, and produce error taxonomies with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover service harm and procedural violations, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
