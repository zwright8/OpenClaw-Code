# Federation Skill Gap Diagnoser

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because cross-org collaboration fails without shared contracts and trust primitives. This specific skill identifies where agents and humans need capability upgrades.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Federation Skill Gap Diagnoser" outcomes in the Federation and Interoperability domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Federation Skill Gap Diagnoser`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to integration breakage and trust boundary violations.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for envelopes, tenant boundaries, and protocol bridges, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using competency coverage analysis, and produce skill gap reports with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover integration breakage and trust boundary violations, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Orchestration integration: task routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit tests, integration tests, simulation checks, and rollout telemetry.
