# Impact Privacy Preserving Data Broker

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because missions need measurable outcomes, not just activity volume. This specific skill enables collaboration while minimizing raw data exposure.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Impact Privacy Preserving Data Broker" outcomes in the Social Impact Measurement domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Impact Privacy Preserving Data Broker`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to impact theater and unmeasured harm.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for community outcomes, KPI trends, and intervention deltas, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using policy-scoped data mediation, and produce privacy-scoped exchanges with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover impact theater and unmeasured harm, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Orchestration integration: task routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit tests, integration tests, simulation checks, and rollout telemetry.
