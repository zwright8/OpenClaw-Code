    "Design and version the input/output contract for code changes, tests, incidents, and rollout data, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using risk-weighted sequencing, and produce risk-gated schedules with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover regressions and brittle release pipelines, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
