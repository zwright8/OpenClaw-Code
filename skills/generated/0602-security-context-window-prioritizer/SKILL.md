# Security Context Window Prioritizer

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because production autonomy must default to least privilege and strong privacy. This specific skill surfaces the most decision-relevant context under tight token budgets.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Security Context Window Prioritizer" outcomes in the Security and Privacy domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Security Context Window Prioritizer`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to breach, exfiltration, and over-privileged actions.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for permissions, sensitive data flows, and threat events, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using importance scoring, and produce ranked context bundles with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover breach, exfiltration, and over-privileged actions, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Runtime profile: planning-router using importance scoring to produce ranked context bundles.
- Orchestration integration: security-and-privacy:planning-router routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit, integration, simulation, regression-baseline suites and rollout telemetry.

## Operational Runbook
### Preflight
- Confirm the Security Context Window Prioritizer request scope, source evidence, and measurable success criteria before execution.
- Verify feature flag skill_0602_security-context-window-prioriti, approval gates, and rollback owner before autonomous use.

### Execution
- Execute importance scoring with deterministic scoring and reproducible trace capture.
- Produce ranked context bundles plus scorecard, assumptions, and unresolved-risk notes.

### Recovery
- Fail closed when required signals, evidence, or approval gates are missing.
- Rollback to the last stable baseline when posture is critical or validation fails.

### Handoff
- Publish ranked context bundles, validation evidence, and telemetry links to downstream owners.
- Queue follow-up tasks for unresolved risks, threshold tuning, or approval review.

## Guardrails
- [quality] Require deterministic scoring and validation evidence before promotion.
- [reliability] Preserve retries, rollback controls, and failure-mode evidence for every run.
- [safety] Route critical posture or missing approval gates to human review before autonomous action.
