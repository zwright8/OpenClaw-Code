    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Collab Uncertainty Communicator`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to deadlocks and degraded trust.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for proposals, contention signals, and negotiated outcomes, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using confidence-bound communication templates, and produce uncertainty briefs with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover deadlocks and degraded trust, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
