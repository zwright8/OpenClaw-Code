# Learning Curriculum Composition for nutrition and meal planning

## Why This Skill Exists
Use learning curriculum composition in nutrition and meal planning with emphasis on clarity, harmony, craft, and emotionally resonant outcomes.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define measurable outcomes for Learning Curriculum Composition for nutrition and meal planning, including baseline and target metrics for nutrition and meal planning.
2. Specify structured inputs/outputs for learning curriculum composition and validate schema contract edge cases.
3. Implement the core learning curriculum composition logic with deterministic scoring and reproducible execution traces.
4. Integrate orchestration policy, routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback for autonomous execution.
5. Run unit, integration, simulation, and regression suites for Learning Curriculum Composition for nutrition and meal planning under beauty and aesthetic appreciation conditions.
6. Roll out behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry, and refine thresholds using observed operational outcomes.

## Operational Runbook
Preflight:
- Validate mission scope, contracts, and required inputs.
- Verify feature flag posture, dependencies, and approval prerequisites.

Execution:
- Execute learning curriculum composition workflow with deterministic scoring and trace capture.
- Track posture transitions and preserve reproducible evidence artifacts.

Recovery:
- Apply rollback strategy if posture is critical or guardrails fail.
- Escalate blocked execution to oversight with incident packet and trace references.

Handoff:
- Publish outcome report, scorecard, and telemetry links.
- Queue follow-up tasks for unresolved risks, approvals, or optimization work.

## Guardrails
- [quality] Require unit and integration validations before promoting Learning Curriculum Composition for nutrition and meal planning. -> `run-validation:unit+integration+simulation+regression-baseline`
- [reliability] Trigger rollback on critical posture or repeated failures. -> `rollback:rollback-to-last-stable-baseline`
- [compliance] Require policy and approval gates prior to autonomous deployment. -> `approval-gates:policy-constraint-check+quality-review`
- [cost] Respect bounded resource pressure and execution budget during scaling. -> `budget-guard:resource-pressure-cap`
