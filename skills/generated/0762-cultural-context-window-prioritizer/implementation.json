  "domain": "Multilingual and Cultural Adaptation",

  "reason": "We need this skill because global utility requires language and cultural context fidelity. This specific skill surfaces the most decision-relevant context under tight token budgets.",
  "implementationGuide": [
    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Cultural Context Window Prioritizer`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to context mismatch and exclusion.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for language variants, cultural norms, and local preferences, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using importance scoring, and produce ranked context bundles with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover context mismatch and exclusion, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
