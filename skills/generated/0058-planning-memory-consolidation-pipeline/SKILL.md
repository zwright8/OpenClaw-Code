# Planning Memory Consolidation Pipeline

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because large goals fail when decomposition is inconsistent or incomplete. This specific skill turns raw logs into durable reusable memory.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Planning Memory Consolidation Pipeline" outcomes in the Strategic Planning and Decomposition domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Planning Memory Consolidation Pipeline`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to execution stalls and hidden dependency failures.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for goals, dependencies, milestones, and constraints, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using episodic-to-semantic consolidation, and produce consolidated memory snapshots with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover execution stalls and hidden dependency failures, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Runtime profile: general-capability using episodic-to-semantic consolidation to produce consolidated memory snapshots.
- Orchestration integration: strategic-planning-and-decomposition:general-capability routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit, integration, simulation, regression-baseline suites and rollout telemetry.

## Operational Runbook
### Preflight
- Confirm the Planning Memory Consolidation Pipeline request scope, source evidence, and measurable success criteria before execution.
- Verify feature flag skill_0058_planning-memory-consolidation-pi, approval gates, and rollback owner before autonomous use.

### Execution
- Execute episodic-to-semantic consolidation with deterministic scoring and reproducible trace capture.
- Produce consolidated memory snapshots plus scorecard, assumptions, and unresolved-risk notes.

### Recovery
- Fail closed when required signals, evidence, or approval gates are missing.
- Rollback to the last stable baseline when posture is critical or validation fails.

### Handoff
- Publish consolidated memory snapshots, validation evidence, and telemetry links to downstream owners.
- Queue follow-up tasks for unresolved risks, threshold tuning, or approval review.

## Guardrails
- [quality] Require deterministic scoring and validation evidence before promotion.
- [reliability] Preserve retries, rollback controls, and failure-mode evidence for every run.
- [safety] Route critical posture or missing approval gates to human review before autonomous action.
