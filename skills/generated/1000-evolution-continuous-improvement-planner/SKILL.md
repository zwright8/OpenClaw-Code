# Evolution Continuous Improvement Planner

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because agents stagnate without structured reflection and continuous improvement loops. This specific skill turns findings into sustained upgrade cycles.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Evolution Continuous Improvement Planner" outcomes in the Autonomous Learning and Evolution domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Evolution Continuous Improvement Planner`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to capability stagnation and repeated blind spots.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for outcomes, error taxonomies, and adaptation decisions, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using closed-loop prioritization, and produce improvement roadmaps with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover capability stagnation and repeated blind spots, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Orchestration integration: task routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit tests, integration tests, simulation checks, and rollout telemetry.
