    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Inclusion Signal Ingestion Normalizer`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to barriers for disabled and underserved groups.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for accessibility audits, accommodations, and usability feedback, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using schema mapping and validation, and produce normalized signal feeds with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover barriers for disabled and underserved groups, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
