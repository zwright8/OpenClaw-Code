# Infra Evidence Provenance Tracker

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because long-term scale depends on resilient and sustainable infrastructure choices. This specific skill preserves source lineage so claims remain auditable.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Infra Evidence Provenance Tracker" outcomes in the Infrastructure and Sustainability domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Infra Evidence Provenance Tracker`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to capacity collapse and environmental debt.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for capacity forecasts, energy usage, and sustainability metrics, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using signed provenance links, and produce evidence lineage graphs with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover capacity collapse and environmental debt, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Runtime profile: provenance-tracker using signed provenance links to produce evidence lineage graphs.
- Orchestration integration: infrastructure-and-sustainability:provenance-tracker routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit, integration, simulation, regression-baseline suites and rollout telemetry.

## Operational Runbook
### Preflight
- Confirm the Infra Evidence Provenance Tracker request scope, source evidence, and measurable success criteria before execution.
- Verify feature flag skill_0923_infra-evidence-provenance-tracke, approval gates, and rollback owner before autonomous use.

### Execution
- Execute signed provenance links with deterministic scoring and reproducible trace capture.
- Produce evidence lineage graphs plus scorecard, assumptions, and unresolved-risk notes.

### Recovery
- Fail closed when required signals, evidence, or approval gates are missing.
- Rollback to the last stable baseline when posture is critical or validation fails.

### Handoff
- Publish evidence lineage graphs, validation evidence, and telemetry links to downstream owners.
- Queue follow-up tasks for unresolved risks, threshold tuning, or approval review.

## Guardrails
- [quality] Require deterministic scoring and validation evidence before promotion.
- [reliability] Preserve retries, rollback controls, and failure-mode evidence for every run.
- [safety] Route critical posture or missing approval gates to human review before autonomous action.
