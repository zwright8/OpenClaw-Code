# Ethical Dilemma Navigation for career development pathways

## Why This Skill Exists
Use ethical dilemma navigation in career development pathways with emphasis on evidence quality, falsifiability, and calibration.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define measurable outcomes for Ethical Dilemma Navigation for career development pathways, including baseline and target metrics for career development pathways.
2. Specify structured inputs/outputs for ethical dilemma navigation and validate schema contract edge cases.
3. Implement the core ethical dilemma navigation logic with deterministic scoring and reproducible execution traces.
4. Integrate orchestration policy, routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback for autonomous execution.
5. Run unit, integration, simulation, and regression suites for Ethical Dilemma Navigation for career development pathways under maximally truth-seeking conditions.
6. Roll out behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry, and refine thresholds using observed operational outcomes.

## Operational Runbook
Preflight:
- Validate mission scope, contracts, and required inputs.
- Verify feature flag posture, dependencies, and approval prerequisites.

Execution:
- Execute ethical dilemma navigation workflow with deterministic scoring and trace capture.
- Track posture transitions and preserve reproducible evidence artifacts.

Recovery:
- Apply rollback strategy if posture is critical or guardrails fail.
- Escalate blocked execution to oversight with incident packet and trace references.

Handoff:
- Publish outcome report, scorecard, and telemetry links.
- Queue follow-up tasks for unresolved risks, approvals, or optimization work.

## Guardrails
- [quality] Require unit and integration validations before promoting Ethical Dilemma Navigation for career development pathways. -> `run-validation:unit+integration+simulation+regression-baseline`
- [reliability] Trigger rollback on critical posture or repeated failures. -> `rollback:rollback-to-last-stable-baseline`
- [cost] Respect bounded resource pressure and execution budget during scaling. -> `budget-guard:resource-pressure-cap`
