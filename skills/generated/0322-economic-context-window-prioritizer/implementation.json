  "title": "Economic Context Window Prioritizer",
  "domain": "Economic Optimization",
  "domainSlug": "economic-optimization",
  "reason": "We need this skill because missions need explicit tradeoff logic for cost, speed, and impact. This specific skill surfaces the most decision-relevant context under tight token budgets.",
  "implementationGuide": [
    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Economic Context Window Prioritizer`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to overspending and low-impact allocation.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for budgets, costs, benefits, and opportunity values, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using importance scoring, and produce ranked context bundles with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover overspending and low-impact allocation, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
