  "domain": "Legal, Rights, and Compliance",
  "domainSlug": "legal-rights-and-compliance",
  "reason": "We need this skill because operations must preserve rights and satisfy jurisdictional obligations. This specific skill prioritizes actions with the strongest net value.",

    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Rights Cost-Benefit Forecaster`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to rights violations and compliance penalties.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for requirements mappings, legal decisions, and evidence trails, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using cost-impact simulation, and produce forecasted ROI scenarios with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover rights violations and compliance penalties, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
