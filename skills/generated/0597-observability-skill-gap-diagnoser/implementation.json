    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Observability Skill Gap Diagnoser`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to data drift and blind spots.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for freshness, drift, schema health, and telemetry coverage, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using competency coverage analysis, and produce skill gap reports with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover data drift and blind spots, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
