# Rights Conflict Resolution Coach

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because operations must preserve rights and satisfy jurisdictional obligations. This specific skill reduces deadlocks in human-agent collaboration loops.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Rights Conflict Resolution Coach" outcomes in the Legal, Rights, and Compliance domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Rights Conflict Resolution Coach`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to rights violations and compliance penalties.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for requirements mappings, legal decisions, and evidence trails, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using guided mediation prompts, and produce conflict remediation playbooks with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover rights violations and compliance penalties, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Runtime profile: collaboration-mediator using guided mediation prompts to produce conflict remediation playbooks.
- Orchestration integration: legal-rights-and-compliance:collaboration-mediator routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit, integration, simulation, regression-baseline suites and rollout telemetry.

## Operational Runbook
### Preflight
- Confirm the Rights Conflict Resolution Coach request scope, source evidence, and measurable success criteria before execution.
- Verify feature flag skill_0903_rights-conflict-resolution-coach, approval gates, and rollback owner before autonomous use.

### Execution
- Execute guided mediation prompts with deterministic scoring and reproducible trace capture.
- Produce conflict remediation playbooks plus scorecard, assumptions, and unresolved-risk notes.

### Recovery
- Fail closed when required signals, evidence, or approval gates are missing.
- Rollback to the last stable baseline when posture is critical or validation fails.

### Handoff
- Publish conflict remediation playbooks, validation evidence, and telemetry links to downstream owners.
- Queue follow-up tasks for unresolved risks, threshold tuning, or approval review.

## Guardrails
- [quality] Require deterministic scoring and validation evidence before promotion.
- [reliability] Preserve retries, rollback controls, and failure-mode evidence for every run.
- [safety] Route critical posture or missing approval gates to human review before autonomous action.
