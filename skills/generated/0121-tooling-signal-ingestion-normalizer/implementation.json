  "domain": "Tool Reliability and Execution Quality",

  "reason": "We need this skill because automation collapses when tools are flaky and failure modes are opaque. This specific skill stabilizes noisy upstream inputs before they contaminate planning.",

    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Tooling Signal Ingestion Normalizer`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to silent failures and cascading retries.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for tool runs, error signatures, and retry outcomes, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using schema mapping and validation, and produce normalized signal feeds with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover silent failures and cascading retries, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
