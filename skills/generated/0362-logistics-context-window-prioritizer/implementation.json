  "domain": "Resource Allocation and Logistics",

  "reason": "We need this skill because impact work fails when scarce resources are not routed intelligently. This specific skill surfaces the most decision-relevant context under tight token budgets.",

    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Logistics Context Window Prioritizer`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to supply shortfalls and fairness gaps.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for capacity, bottlenecks, and distribution plans, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using importance scoring, and produce ranked context bundles with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover supply shortfalls and fairness gaps, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
