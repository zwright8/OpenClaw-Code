    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Memory Semantic Retrieval Ranker`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to repeated mistakes and context loss.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for episodic logs, knowledge nodes, and retrieval metadata, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using semantic relevance scoring, and produce ranked retrieval results with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover repeated mistakes and context loss, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
