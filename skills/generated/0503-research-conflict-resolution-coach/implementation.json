    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Research Conflict Resolution Coach`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to non-reproducible results and wasted cycles.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for hypotheses, experiments, and replication evidence, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using guided mediation prompts, and produce conflict remediation playbooks with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover non-reproducible results and wasted cycles, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
