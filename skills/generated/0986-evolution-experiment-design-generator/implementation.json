    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Evolution Experiment Design Generator`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to capability stagnation and repeated blind spots.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for outcomes, error taxonomies, and adaptation decisions, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using hypothesis-driven design, and produce experiment plans with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover capability stagnation and repeated blind spots, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
