  "domain": "Economic Optimization",

  "reason": "We need this skill because missions need explicit tradeoff logic for cost, speed, and impact. This specific skill improves success rates while preventing retry storms.",

    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Economic Auto-Retry and Backoff Coordinator`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to overspending and low-impact allocation.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for budgets, costs, benefits, and opportunity values, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using adaptive backoff control, and produce retry policy decisions with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover overspending and low-impact allocation, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
