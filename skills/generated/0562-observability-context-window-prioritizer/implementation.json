  "domain": "Data Quality and Observability",

  "reason": "We need this skill because decisions are only as good as the quality and visibility of data. This specific skill surfaces the most decision-relevant context under tight token budgets.",
  "implementationGuide": [
    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Observability Context Window Prioritizer`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to data drift and blind spots.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for freshness, drift, schema health, and telemetry coverage, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using importance scoring, and produce ranked context bundles with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover data drift and blind spots, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
