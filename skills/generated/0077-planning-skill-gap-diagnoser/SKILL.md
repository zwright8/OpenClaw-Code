description: Build and operate the "Planning Skill Gap Diagnoser" capability for Strategic Planning and Decomposition. Trigger when this exact capability is needed in mission execution.

# Planning Skill Gap Diagnoser

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because large goals fail when decomposition is inconsistent or incomplete. This specific skill identifies where agents and humans need capability upgrades.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Planning Skill Gap Diagnoser" outcomes in the Strategic Planning and Decomposition domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Planning Skill Gap Diagnoser`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to execution stalls and hidden dependency failures.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for goals, dependencies, milestones, and constraints, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using competency coverage analysis, and produce skill gap reports with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover execution stalls and hidden dependency failures, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Orchestration integration: task routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit tests, integration tests, simulation checks, and rollout telemetry.
