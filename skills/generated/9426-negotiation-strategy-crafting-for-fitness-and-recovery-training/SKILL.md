# Negotiation Strategy Crafting for fitness and recovery training

## Why This Skill Exists
Use negotiation strategy crafting in fitness and recovery training with emphasis on evidence quality, falsifiability, and calibration.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define measurable outcomes for Negotiation Strategy Crafting for fitness and recovery training, including baseline and target metrics for fitness and recovery training.
2. Specify structured inputs/outputs for negotiation strategy crafting and validate schema contract edge cases.
3. Implement the core negotiation strategy crafting logic with deterministic scoring and reproducible execution traces.
4. Integrate orchestration policy, routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback for autonomous execution.
5. Run unit, integration, simulation, and regression suites for Negotiation Strategy Crafting for fitness and recovery training under maximally truth-seeking conditions.
6. Roll out behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry, and refine thresholds using observed operational outcomes.

## Operational Runbook
Preflight:
- Validate mission scope, contracts, and required inputs.
- Verify feature flag posture, dependencies, and approval prerequisites.

Execution:
- Execute negotiation strategy crafting workflow with deterministic scoring and trace capture.
- Track posture transitions and preserve reproducible evidence artifacts.

Recovery:
- Apply rollback strategy if posture is critical or guardrails fail.
- Escalate blocked execution to oversight with incident packet and trace references.

Handoff:
- Publish outcome report, scorecard, and telemetry links.
- Queue follow-up tasks for unresolved risks, approvals, or optimization work.

## Guardrails
- [quality] Require unit and integration validations before promoting Negotiation Strategy Crafting for fitness and recovery training. -> `run-validation:unit+integration+simulation+regression-baseline`
- [reliability] Trigger rollback on critical posture or repeated failures. -> `rollback:rollback-to-last-stable-baseline`
- [cost] Respect bounded resource pressure and execution budget during scaling. -> `budget-guard:resource-pressure-cap`
