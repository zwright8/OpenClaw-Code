    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Education Confidence Calibration Engine`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to persistent skill gaps and poor learning outcomes.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for skill profiles, learning paths, and support resources, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using calibration curves and error bins, and produce calibrated confidence scores with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover persistent skill gaps and poor learning outcomes, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
