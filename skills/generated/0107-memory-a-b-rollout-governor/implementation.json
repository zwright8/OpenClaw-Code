    "Implement the core capability using staged rollout policies, and produce safe rollout decisions with deterministic scoring.",

    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover repeated mistakes and context loss, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
