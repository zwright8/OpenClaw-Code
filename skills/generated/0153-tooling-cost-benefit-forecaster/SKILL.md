# Tooling Cost-Benefit Forecaster

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because automation collapses when tools are flaky and failure modes are opaque. This specific skill prioritizes actions with the strongest net value.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Tooling Cost-Benefit Forecaster" outcomes in the Tool Reliability and Execution Quality domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Tooling Cost-Benefit Forecaster`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to silent failures and cascading retries.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for tool runs, error signatures, and retry outcomes, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using cost-impact simulation, and produce forecasted ROI scenarios with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover silent failures and cascading retries, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Orchestration integration: task routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit tests, integration tests, simulation checks, and rollout telemetry.
