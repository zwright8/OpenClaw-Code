    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Infra Security Threat Modeler`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to capacity collapse and environmental debt.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for capacity forecasts, energy usage, and sustainability metrics, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using attack-surface modeling, and produce threat models with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover capacity collapse and environmental debt, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
