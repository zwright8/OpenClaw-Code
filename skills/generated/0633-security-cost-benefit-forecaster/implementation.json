  "domain": "Security and Privacy",

  "reason": "We need this skill because production autonomy must default to least privilege and strong privacy. This specific skill prioritizes actions with the strongest net value.",

    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Security Cost-Benefit Forecaster`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to breach, exfiltration, and over-privileged actions.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for permissions, sensitive data flows, and threat events, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using cost-impact simulation, and produce forecasted ROI scenarios with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover breach, exfiltration, and over-privileged actions, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
