# Memory Equity Impact Scorer

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because agents lose performance when lessons are not retained and reused. This specific skill exposes uneven benefit/harm distribution before rollout.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Memory Equity Impact Scorer" outcomes in the Memory and Knowledge Operations domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Memory Equity Impact Scorer`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to repeated mistakes and context loss.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for episodic logs, knowledge nodes, and retrieval metadata, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using group-level impact scoring, and produce equity impact profiles with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover repeated mistakes and context loss, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Orchestration integration: task routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit tests, integration tests, simulation checks, and rollout telemetry.
