  "domain": "Strategic Planning and Decomposition",

  "reason": "We need this skill because large goals fail when decomposition is inconsistent or incomplete. This specific skill matches mission ambition to finite execution capacity.",
  "implementationGuide": [
    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Planning Resource Budget Allocator`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to execution stalls and hidden dependency failures.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for goals, dependencies, milestones, and constraints, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using capacity-aware allocation, and produce budgeted execution plans with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover execution stalls and hidden dependency failures, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
