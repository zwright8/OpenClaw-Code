    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Logistics Knowledge Graph Linker`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to supply shortfalls and fairness gaps.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for capacity, bottlenecks, and distribution plans, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using entity and relation linking, and produce linked knowledge entities with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover supply shortfalls and fairness gaps, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
