# Governance Security Threat Modeler

## Why This Skill Exists
We need this skill because high-speed autonomy needs enforceable guardrails to stay aligned. This specific skill anticipates attack paths before adversaries exploit them.

## When To Use
Use this skill when the request explicitly needs "Governance Security Threat Modeler" outcomes in the Safety and Governance domain.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Governance Security Threat Modeler`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to unsafe actions and policy drift.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for policies, violations, and mitigation actions, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using attack-surface modeling, and produce threat models with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover unsafe actions and policy drift, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

## Required Deliverables
- Capability contract: input schema, deterministic scoring, output schema, and failure modes.
- Orchestration integration: task routing, approval gates, retries, and rollback controls.
- Validation evidence: unit tests, integration tests, simulation checks, and rollout telemetry.
