  "reason": "We need this skill because large goals fail when decomposition is inconsistent or incomplete. This specific skill quantifies whether plans are complete, safe, and feasible.",

    "Define the scope and success metrics for `Planning Plan Quality Evaluator`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to execution stalls and hidden dependency failures.",
    "Design and version the input/output contract for goals, dependencies, milestones, and constraints, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.",
    "Implement the core capability using multi-criteria plan scoring, and produce plan quality scorecards with deterministic scoring.",
    "Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.",
    "Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover execution stalls and hidden dependency failures, then run regression baselines.",
    "Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes."
