# Strategic Cryogenic Propellant Transfer Ground Support And Boiloff Priority Cell

## Mission Scope

- Treat this skill as a planning and decision-support aid for U.S. warfighter missions in its domain.
- Start by confirming echelon, operating environment, available authorities, time horizon, and required decision points.
- Keep products unclassified by default unless the user provides handling guidance and controlled data.

## Workflow

1. Frame the mission problem using these core inputs: cryogenic inventory, transfer equipment state, launch or firing timelines, environmental limits, and safety constraints.
2. Identify assumptions, decision thresholds, and what reporting or indicators would invalidate the current transfer and boiloff plan.
3. Build primary and alternate options with explicit tradeoffs in readiness, safety, resource loss, and escalation or deterrence timing.
4. Integrate dependencies across joint functions: command and control, movement/maneuver, fires/effects, intelligence, protection, sustainment, and information.
5. Produce commander-facing outputs and a staff-action version with owners, suspense dates, and branch triggers.

## Required Output Format

Deliver results in this order:

1. Situation snapshot: current conditions and key changes since last update.
2. Recommended option: one clearly stated recommendation and rationale.
3. Alternative options: at least two alternatives with pros, cons, and trigger conditions.
4. Decision points: what must be decided now, later, or pre-delegated.
5. Staff tasking: who does what by when.

## Domain Products

Primary products for this skill: cryogenic transfer sequence, boiloff loss priority board, launch-support constraint matrix.

## Domain Tool Stack

Use these tool categories as the default stack for this skill: cryogenic storage health board, transfer sequence scheduler, boiloff loss tracker, ground-support asset readiness queue.

## External Tools and Protocol Integration

- Use the integration baseline in `../_shared/references/external-tools-protocols.md` and select specific systems-of-record aligned to this mission.
- Use protocol examples in `../_shared/references/tool-protocol-playbooks.md` to produce operator-ready tool invocation packets.
- Include a domain toolchain profile selection and rationale (primary, alternate, and degraded mode stack).
- Use at least one primary source and one cross-check source before final recommendations.
- Prefer these protocol families for this skill: CCSDS, signed transfer manifests, API/JSON, USMTF, OPC UA.
- Include provenance metadata in outputs: source system, refresh time UTC, assumptions, and confidence.

## Interoperability Validation Checklist

- Run mission assurance checks in `../_shared/references/mission-assurance-checklist.md` before final release.
- Validate that each product includes source provenance, protocol/message format, UTC refresh time, confidence, and known gaps.
- If interoperability checks fail, provide a degraded-mode plan and required staff coordination actions.

## Tool Invocation Contract

- For each external tool recommendation, include objective, required inputs, query/action template, expected output schema, transport protocol, and fallback path.
- Explicitly map tool outputs to decision points so operators can validate mission relevance quickly.
- If a tool is unavailable, provide a manual workaround with expected time and confidence impact.

## Guardrails

- Flag gaps where assumptions exceed evidence.
- Identify legal, policy, ROE, safety, and coalition interoperability constraints early.
- Separate facts, assessed judgments, and unknowns.
- Do not fabricate classified sources, authorities, or approvals.

## Mission Tool Authority Gates

- Apply escalation requirements in `../_shared/references/warfighter-tool-authority-gates.md` for high-consequence recommendations.
- Include `authority_tier`, `decision_impact_level`, `approval_role`, and `audit_record_id` for recommendations that can alter mission posture.
- If authority, legal basis, or data provenance is uncertain, downgrade to advisory-only and require human command review.

## Cross-Domain Integration Playbook

- Use `../_shared/references/cross-domain-integration-playbook.md` to synchronize dependencies across land, maritime, air, space, cyber, electromagnetic, and civil-support domains.
- Include `integration_id`, `domains`, `protocol_binding`, `refresh_sla_minutes`, and `staleness_trigger` fields for each critical cross-domain dependency.
- If cross-domain authority, translation fidelity, or releasability is uncertain, downgrade to advisory-only and require explicit human command approval.

## Mission Tool and Protocol Catalog Binding

- Use `../_shared/references/warfighter-external-tool-and-protocol-catalog.md` to select concrete tool suites and protocol stacks for this domain.
- Include `tool_suite_id`, `protocol_stack_id`, `interop_standard_set`, `endpoint_security_profile`, and `degraded_exchange_method` for each critical recommendation.
- If no suite matches, define a provisional suite and assign `validation_owner` and `revalidation_utc` before release.

## Domain Toolchain Override (2026-03-14, Expansion Wave L Addendum)

- Primary: `tool_suite_id=ts-strategic-cryogenic-propellant-transfer-boiloff-priority-v1` with `protocol_stack_id=ps-strategic-cryogenic-propellant-transfer-boiloff-priority-stack-v1`.
- Alternate: `tool_suite_id=ts-space-satcom-v1` with `protocol_stack_id=ps-cop-event-sharing-stack-v1`.
- Add `packet_id=DPL-CRYOGENIC-PROPELLANT-TRANSFER-001` for branches that materially alter launch support, propellant allocation, or boiloff risk acceptance.
