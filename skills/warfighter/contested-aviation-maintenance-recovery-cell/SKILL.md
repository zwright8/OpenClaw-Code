# Contested Aviation Maintenance Recovery Cell

## Mission Scope

- Treat this skill as a planning and decision-support aid for U.S. warfighter missions in its domain.
- Start by confirming echelon, operating environment, available authorities, time horizon, and required decision points.
- Keep products unclassified by default unless the user provides handling guidance and controlled data.

## Workflow

1. Frame the mission problem using these core inputs: commander intent, threat and environment updates, force and readiness status, and supporting authorities.
2. Identify assumptions, decision thresholds, and what reporting or indicators would invalidate the current plan.
3. Build primary and alternate options with explicit tradeoffs in tempo, survivability, sustainment burden, and escalation risk.
4. Integrate dependencies across joint functions: command and control, movement/maneuver, fires/effects, intelligence, protection, sustainment, and information.
5. Produce commander-facing outputs and a staff-action version with owners, suspense dates, and branch triggers.

## Required Output Format

Deliver results in this order:

1. Situation snapshot: current conditions and key changes since last update.
2. Recommended option: one clearly stated recommendation and rationale.
3. Alternative options: at least two alternatives with pros, cons, and trigger conditions.
4. Decision points: what must be decided now, later, or pre-delegated.
5. Staff tasking: who does what by when.

## Domain Products

Primary products for this skill: Aircraft recovery priority queue, cannibalization decision board, sortie regeneration forecast.

## External Tools and Protocol Integration

- Use the integration baseline in `../_shared/references/external-tools-protocols.md` and the action templates in `../_shared/references/tool-protocol-playbooks.md`.
- Include a domain toolchain profile selection and rationale (primary, alternate, and degraded-mode stack).
- Choose at least one primary system-of-record and one cross-check source before final recommendations.
- State the protocol or message format for outbound coordination (for example `USMTF`, `VMF`, `Link 16 J-series`, `CoT`, `STIX/TAXII`, `OGC`, or `NATO APP-11/ADatP-3`).
- Include provenance metadata in outputs: source system, refresh time (UTC), assumptions, and confidence.

## Interoperability Validation Checklist

- Run the mission assurance workflow in `../_shared/references/mission-assurance-checklist.md` before final release.
- Validate that each product includes source provenance, protocol/message format, UTC refresh time, confidence, and known gaps.
- If interoperability checks fail, provide a degraded-mode plan and required staff coordination actions.

## Tool Invocation Contract

- For each external tool recommendation, include: objective, required inputs, query/action template, expected output schema, transport protocol, and fallback path.
- Explicitly map tool outputs to decision points so operators can validate mission relevance quickly.
- If a tool is unavailable, provide a manual workaround with expected time and confidence impact.

## Machine-Readable Output Contract

- Provide a compact handoff block with fields: `mission_id`, `decision_window_utc`, `recommendation_id`, `option_rank`, `trigger_conditions`, `required_actions`, `tool_dependencies`, `protocols`, `confidence`, and `known_gaps`.
- Structure tasking entries as `owner`, `action`, `due_utc`, `status`, and `dependency` to enable direct ingestion by workflow systems.
- Include an explicit `degraded_mode` object listing fallback tools, expected delay, and confidence penalty when integrations fail.

## Cross-Domain Escalation Hooks

- Identify at least two adjacent cells or staff functions that must be notified when risk crosses thresholds (for example fires, intel, cyber, logistics, legal, coalition liaison).
- Include escalation triggers in measurable terms and map each trigger to an owner and required report format.
- Provide a no-fail communication fallback for each escalation path (alternate network, voice relay, or courier) with expected delay.

## Guardrails

- Flag gaps where assumptions exceed evidence.
- Identify legal, policy, ROE, safety, and coalition interoperability constraints early.
- Separate facts, assessed judgments, and unknowns.
- Do not fabricate classified sources, authorities, or approvals.

## U.S. Warfighter Tool Auth and Access Drill

- Use `../_shared/references/us-warfighter-tool-auth-and-access-drill.md` to verify account state, role binding, and transport availability before critical actions.
- If any critical integration lacks valid credentials, publish a degraded-mode branch and request revalidation suspense.
- Record auth/access status in the output handoff so downstream cells can execute without re-triage.

## U.S. Joint Tool Adapter Contract Drill

- Use `../_shared/references/us-joint-tool-adapter-contracts.md` to define adapter_id, protocol, auth mode, and fallback per critical dependency.
- Include adapter health status and last-success UTC for each mission-critical integration.
- Trigger degraded-mode and escalation actions when adapter latency, failures, or schema drift exceed mission thresholds.

## U.S. Joint Protocol Assurance Drill

- Use `../_shared/references/us-joint-protocol-assurance-drill.md` to run a mandatory pre-release drill for protocol conformance, cryptographic trust, and message acknowledgment integrity.
- Include `assurance_drill_id`, `interop_score`, `crypto_posture`, and `ack_chain_status` fields for each critical recommendation.
- If the drill fails any gate, publish a constrained-employment recommendation with specific remediation owners and suspense.
