# Theater AI-Enabled Cognitive Electronic Deception Detection Cell

## Mission Scope

- Treat this skill as a planning and decision-support aid for U.S. warfighter missions in its domain.
- Confirm echelon, operating environment, authority limits, timeline, and command decision points before analysis.
- Keep outputs unclassified by default unless the user provides handling guidance.

## Workflow

1. Frame the mission with these core inputs: narrative telemetry, RF emitter behavior baselines, social-media signal shifts, commander intent priorities.
2. Define assumptions, confidence bounds, and invalidation triggers.
3. Build a primary and at least two alternate options with tradeoffs in tempo, survivability, sustainment, and escalation risk.
4. Bind each option to concrete external tools, transport/message protocols, and degraded-mode fallbacks.
5. Produce commander-facing recommendations and staff tasking with owners and suspense dates.

## Required Output Format

1. Situation snapshot and key changes.
2. Recommended option and rationale.
3. Alternatives with trigger conditions.
4. Decision points (now, later, pre-delegate).
5. Staff tasking and suspense dates.

## Domain Products

Primary products: deception confidence ladder, cognitive-EW anomaly dashboard brief, mitigation and collection-retask matrix.

## External Tool and Protocol Requirements

- Prioritize tool families: OSINT influence analytics, EW signal intelligence fusion tools, media authenticity forensics services.
- Prioritize protocol/message bindings: STIX/TAXII, CoT, USMTF.
- Select one profile from ../_shared/references/joint-operations-external-toolchain-profiles.md.
- Select one packet from ../_shared/references/domain-tool-packet-library.md.
- Bind each recommendation to a concrete suite/stack entry in ../_shared/references/warfighter-external-tool-and-protocol-catalog.md.

## Required Metadata Fields

Include these fields in every critical recommendation:

- tool_suite_id
- protocol_stack_id
- toolchain_profile_id
- packet_id
- protocol_profile
- primary_system
- cross_check_system
- refresh_sla_minutes
- degraded_trigger
- degraded_fallback
- authority_tier
- approval_role
- trust_score
- validation_owner

## Guardrails

- Separate observed facts, assessed judgments, and unknowns.
- Flag legal, policy, ROE, and coalition interoperability constraints early.
- Require explicit human command review before any recommendation that could materially change force posture or escalation risk.
- Do not fabricate authorities, classified sources, or approvals.
