## Endpoint Security Profiles

- `esp-mission-secret-api-gateway-v1`: authenticated enclave API gateway with signed payload and schema checks.
- `esp-cross-domain-guarded-transfer-v1`: mediated transfer via approved CDS/guard with releasability gates.
- `esp-tactical-mesh-forward-v1`: intermittent edge transport with queued retries and hash-based integrity checks.
- `esp-coalition-releasable-bridge-v1`: coalition bridge enforcing caveat tags, field-level redaction, and translation audit.

## Selection Rules

1. Select one `tool_suite_id` and one `protocol_stack_id` before producing options.
2. Use a cross-check source unless a single validated authoritative source is mandated.
3. Bind each critical recommendation to an endpoint security profile.
4. If transport degrades, publish a degraded exchange method with timeline impact.
5. Include one machine-ingestible payload plus one commander-readable summary.
6. If no listed suite fits, create a provisional entry and assign a validation owner and suspense.
