## Selection Rules

1. Select one `tool_suite_id` and one `protocol_stack_id` before producing options.
2. Use a cross-check source unless a single validated authoritative source is mandated.
3. Bind each critical recommendation to an endpoint security profile.
4. If transport degrades, publish a degraded exchange method with timeline impact.
5. Include one machine-ingestible payload plus one commander-readable summary.
6. If no listed suite fits, create a provisional entry and assign a validation owner and suspense.
