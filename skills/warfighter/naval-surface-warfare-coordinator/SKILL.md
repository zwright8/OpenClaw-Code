description: Support U.S. warfighter planning and decision support for Naval Surface Warfare Coordinator. Use when missions require surface warfare force employment and maritime sea-control decisions, integrated options, and protocol-aware staff outputs.

# Naval Surface Warfare Coordinator

## Mission Scope

- Treat this skill as a planning and decision-support aid for U.S. warfighter missions in its domain.
- Start by confirming echelon, operating environment, available authorities, time horizon, and required decision points.
- Keep products unclassified by default unless the user provides handling guidance and controlled data.

## Workflow

1. Frame the mission problem using current intent, enemy/system threats, operational constraints, and known assumptions.
2. Define measurable objectives, risk thresholds, branch conditions, and indicators that would invalidate the preferred plan.
3. Build a recommended option and at least two alternatives with explicit tradeoffs in tempo, survivability, sustainment load, and escalation risk.
4. Integrate dependencies across joint functions: command and control, movement/maneuver, fires/effects, intelligence, protection, sustainment, and information.
5. Convert the decision into execution-ready products with owners, suspense dates, coordination links, and required reports.

## Required Output Format

Deliver results in this order:

1. Situation snapshot: current conditions and key changes since the last update.
2. Recommended option: one clearly stated recommendation and rationale.
3. Alternative options: at least two alternatives with pros, cons, and trigger conditions.
4. Decision points: what must be decided now, later, or pre-delegated.
5. Staff tasking: who does what by when.

## Domain Products

Primary products for this skill: surface action group posture matrix, sea-control risk map, weapons employment synchronization plan.

## Domain Tool Stack

Use these tool categories as the default stack for this skill: maritime C2 systems, tactical track managers, naval fires coordination systems, afloat mission planning tools.

## External Tools and Protocol Integration

- Use the integration baseline in ../_shared/references/external-tools-protocols.md and select specific systems-of-record aligned to this mission.
- Use protocol examples in ../_shared/references/tool-protocol-playbooks.md to produce operator-ready tool invocation packets.
- Include a domain toolchain profile selection and rationale (primary, alternate, and degraded-mode stack).
- Use at least one primary source and one cross-check source before final recommendations.
- Prefer these protocol families for this skill: Link 16 J-series, USMTF, CoT.
- Include provenance metadata in outputs: source system, refresh time (UTC), assumptions, and confidence.

## Interoperability Validation Checklist

- Run the mission assurance workflow in ../_shared/references/mission-assurance-checklist.md before final release.
- Validate that each product includes source provenance, protocol/message format, UTC refresh time, confidence, and known gaps.
- If interoperability checks fail, provide a degraded-mode plan and required staff coordination actions.

## Tool Invocation Contract

- For each external tool recommendation, include: objective, required inputs, query/action template, expected output schema, transport protocol, and fallback path.
- Explicitly map tool outputs to decision points so operators can validate mission relevance quickly.
- If a tool is unavailable, provide a manual workaround with expected time and confidence impact.

## Guardrails

- Flag gaps where assumptions exceed evidence.
- Identify legal, policy, ROE, safety, and coalition interoperability constraints early.
- Separate facts, assessed judgments, and unknowns.
- Do not fabricate classified sources, authorities, or approvals.

## Tool Protocol Playbooks

- Use protocol examples in ../_shared/references/tool-protocol-playbooks.md to produce operator-ready tool invocation packets.
- Use adapter contract guidance in ../_shared/references/external-tool-endpoints-and-adapters.md to define endpoint schemas, transport, and fallback behavior.
- Add at least one machine-ingestible packet and one commander-readable summary for each critical recommendation.

## Domain Tool Packet Library

- Use scenario packets in ../_shared/references/domain-tool-packet-library.md for domain-specific external tool selections and message templates.
- Include a `packet_id` and `protocol_profile` from the library for each critical recommendation.
- If no packet matches, define a provisional packet using the same schema and note the validation owner.

## Domain Data Contract

- Use mapping guidance in ../_shared/references/joint-mission-data-contracts.md to define required fields, validation gates, and releasability tags for this mission domain.
- Ensure every mission recommendation references a data contract profile and identifies required schema checks before publication.

## Operational Learning Loop

- Use `../_shared/references/operational-learning-and-after-action-loop.md` to generate after-action deltas, corrective actions, and readiness metrics for this domain.
- Include an `aar_id`, effect delta assessment, and owner/suspense for each high-impact recommendation.
- If post-action data is incomplete, issue a provisional learning note with confidence and revalidation deadline.

## Readiness Certification Evidence Pack

- Use `../_shared/references/readiness-certification-evidence-pack.md` to define mission-essential task evidence, evaluator triggers, and certification confidence scoring.
- Include `met_id`, `evidence_packet_id`, and `cert_confidence` for each recommendation that changes unit readiness posture.
- If required evidence is missing, mark status as `provisional` and assign closure actions with suspense.

## Protocol Execution Sequence

- Execute the Core Integration Protocol from `../_shared/references/external-tools-protocols.md` as an explicit step sequence, not as guidance only.
- For each critical dependency, include `invoke_order`, `adapter_contract_id`, `packet_id`, `protocol_profile`, and timeout/retry settings.
- Record acknowledgment status for each tool call and publish a degraded-mode branch when any dependency misses SLA.
- Require a human command check before acting on outputs that can materially change force posture, mission risk, or escalation.
