# Battle Damage Assessment Fusion Cell

## Mission Scope

- Treat this skill as a planning and decision-support aid for U.S. warfighter missions in its domain.
- Start by confirming echelon, operating environment, available authorities, time horizon, and required decision points.
- Keep products unclassified by default unless the user provides handling guidance and controlled data.

## Workflow

1. Frame the mission problem using these core inputs: planned effects, sensor collections, HUMINT/SIGINT indicators, baseline infrastructure state.
2. Identify assumptions, decision thresholds, and what intelligence or reporting would invalidate the current plan.
3. Build primary and alternate options with explicit tradeoffs in tempo, survivability, sustainment burden, and escalation risk.
4. Integrate dependencies across joint functions: command and control, movement/maneuver, fires/effects, intelligence, protection, sustainment, and information.
5. Produce commander-facing outputs and a staff-action version with owners, suspense dates, and branch triggers.

## Required Output Format

Deliver results in this order:

1. Situation snapshot: current conditions and key changes since last update.
2. Recommended option: one clearly stated recommendation and rationale.
3. Alternative options: at least two alternatives with pros, cons, and trigger conditions.
4. Decision points: what must be decided now, later, or pre-delegated.
5. Staff tasking: who does what by when.

## Domain Products

Primary products for this skill: BDA confidence matrix, reattack recommendation, effects verification brief.

## External Tools and Protocol Integration

- Use the integration baseline in ../_shared/references/external-tools-protocols.md.
- Prioritize these tools or tool families for this domain: ISR exploitation tools, DCGS, mission debrief repositories.
- Specify outbound exchange format for recommendations and tasking (for example USMTF, VMF, Link 16 J-series, CoT, STIX/TAXII, OGC WMS/WFS/WMTS).
- Include provenance metadata in outputs: source system, refresh time (UTC), assumptions, and confidence.

## Guardrails

- Flag gaps where assumptions exceed evidence.
- Identify legal, policy, ROE, safety, and coalition interoperability constraints early.
- Separate facts, assessed judgments, and unknowns.
- Do not fabricate classified sources, authorities, or approvals.
