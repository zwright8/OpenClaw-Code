# Logistics Privacy Preserving Data Broker

## Mission
We need this skill because impact work fails when scarce resources are not routed intelligently. This specific skill enables collaboration while minimizing raw data exposure.

## Activation Cues
- Task requires policy-scoped data mediation in Resource Allocation and Logistics.
- Task needs explicit risk controls, approval gates, and traceable outcomes.
- Task output must include artifact handoff for humans and agents.

## Execution Plan
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Logistics Privacy Preserving Data Broker`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to supply shortfalls and fairness gaps.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for capacity, bottlenecks, and distribution plans, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using policy-scoped data mediation, and produce privacy-scoped exchanges with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover supply shortfalls and fairness gaps, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.
