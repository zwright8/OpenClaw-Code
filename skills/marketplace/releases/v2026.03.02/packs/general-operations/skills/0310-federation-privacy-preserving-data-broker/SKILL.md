# Federation Privacy Preserving Data Broker

## Mission
We need this skill because cross-org collaboration fails without shared contracts and trust primitives. This specific skill enables collaboration while minimizing raw data exposure.

## Activation Cues
- Task requires policy-scoped data mediation in Federation and Interoperability.
- Task needs explicit risk controls, approval gates, and traceable outcomes.
- Task output must include artifact handoff for humans and agents.

## Execution Plan
1. Define the scope and success metrics for `Federation Privacy Preserving Data Broker`, including at least three measurable KPIs tied to integration breakage and trust boundary violations.
2. Design and version the input/output contract for envelopes, tenant boundaries, and protocol bridges, then add schema validation and failure-mode handling.
3. Implement the core capability using policy-scoped data mediation, and produce privacy-scoped exchanges with deterministic scoring.
4. Integrate the skill into swarm orchestration: task routing, approval gates, retry strategy, and rollback controls.
5. Add unit, integration, and simulation tests that explicitly cover integration breakage and trust boundary violations, then run regression baselines.
6. Deploy behind a feature flag, monitor telemetry/alerts for two release cycles, and iterate thresholds based on observed outcomes.

Preflight:
- None specified.

Execution:
- None specified.

Recovery:
- None specified.

Handoff:
- None specified.

## Guardrails
- [quality] Require validations before promoting outputs.

## Success Metrics
- Primary metric: integration breakage
- Secondary metrics: trust boundary violations, decision drift
- Review cadence: weekly

## Output Contract
- Return a concise execution summary with key decisions.
- Return risk and mitigation notes with unresolved blockers.
- Return artifact target: `privacy-scoped exchanges`.
- Return recommended follow-up tasks for next wave execution.
